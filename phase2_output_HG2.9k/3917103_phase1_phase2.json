Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.5",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["os.path.join added in Python 3.5 â†’ min Python 3.5"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "gmusicapi": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "gmusicapi>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["gmusicapi.Api added in v1.2.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "gmusicapi>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
In this JSON object:

* The `python_version` field contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required for the project, as well as the evidence that led to these conclusions. The `notes` field is empty because there are no assumptions or conflicting APIs that might affect the version range.
* The `dependencies` field contains a dictionary of dependency names and their inferred version ranges. For each dependency, we provide the recommended requirements line, which can be used in the `requirements.txt` file to specify the required versions. The evidence field contains a list of statements that map APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, along with the confidence level for each statement (in this case, all statements have a confidence level of 1.0).
* The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies. This is derived from the `dependencies` field and can be used to specify the required versions in a `requirements.txt` file.
