Here is the final JSON object:
```json

    "min": null,
    "max": null,
    "evidence": [],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {

      "evidence": [

    },
    "numpy": {

      "recommended_requirements_line": "numpy>=1,<2",
      "evidence": [

      ],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "keras>=2.4,<3",
    "numpy>=1,<2"
  ]
}
```
Note that the `python_version` section is empty because it is not possible to determine a reliable upper or lower bound for Python versions based on the extracted APIs provided.
The `dependencies` section includes information about the inferred version range for each external package and the recommended requirements line, as well as evidence about the introduction, deprecation, removal, or change of each API in that package. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies with their recommended requirements lines.
Please let me know if you have any further questions!
