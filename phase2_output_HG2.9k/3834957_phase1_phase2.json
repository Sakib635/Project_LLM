Here is the JSON object that corresponds to the given extracted APIs:
```json

  },
  "dependencies": {

  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "locale>=3.6",
    "subprocess>=3.4,<3.7"
  ]
}
```
Note that the `python_version` field indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions that are compatible with the extracted APIs, based on the information available. The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used in the code, including its inferred version range (if possible), a recommended requirements line for installing the package, evidence of why this version range was inferred or chosen, and a confidence score indicating how reliable the inference is. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all packages and their recommended requirements lines that are required to run the code.
