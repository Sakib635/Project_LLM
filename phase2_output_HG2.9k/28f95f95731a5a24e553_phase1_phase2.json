The JSON object includes the following fields:

* `python_version`: Indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions that can be used with the project. The `min` field specifies the earliest version of Python that is compatible with the project, while the `max` field specifies the latest version of Python that is supported. The `evidence` field lists short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary mapping each package name to its inferred version range and recommended requirements line. If a package has no inferred version range, the field will be null. The evidence field lists short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. The confidence field specifies the level of confidence in the version range inference (0.0–1.0).
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
