Note: The JSON object above meets the requirements for the output, but it does not provide any useful information about the Python version or external packages used in the project. To provide more accurate inferences, you may need to analyze the extracted APIs further and consider other factors such as the package versions used in the project, the dependencies' version ranges in the requirements file, and the changes made to the standard library over time.
