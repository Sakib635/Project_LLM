}
```
The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum and maximum Python versions are unknown, as there is no information in the extracted APIs about the required version of Python.

The `dependencies` field contains information about the inferred version ranges for each dependency package. For example, the `pandas` package has an inferred version range of ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0", which means that the minimum version is 1.2.0 and the maximum version is less than 2.0.0.

The `recommended_requirements_line` field contains a string representing the recommended requirement line for each package, which can be used in the `requirements.txt` file to specify the required version of the package.

The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, and the `confidence` field indicates the level of confidence that the version range is accurate (0.0â€“1.0). The `notes` field contains any additional information or assumptions.

The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies with their recommended requirement lines in the format "pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C".
