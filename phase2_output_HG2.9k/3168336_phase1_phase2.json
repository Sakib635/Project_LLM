Here is the final JSON object:

      "evidence": ["avahi.DBUS_NAME added in v0.7.3 → min avahi 0.7.3", "avahi.GetHostNameFqdn added in v0.8.0 → max avahi 0.8.0"],

      "notes": ""

  },
  "requirements.txt": ["dbus>=3.7", "avahi>=0.7.3"]
}
```
This JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: Minimum and maximum Python version required based on the extracted APIs provided, with evidence of how these versions were inferred and any notes about assumptions made.
* `dependencies`: For each external package used in the project, an object containing its recommended requirements line (either a range or a specific version), along with inference evidence, confidence score, and any notes about conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items. The list of all dependencies is also included in the `requirements.txt` field.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all required packages and their recommended requirements lines.

The output JSON object is valid and follows the provided schema, with each package's inferred version range (if any) based on its API usage, along with evidence of how these ranges were inferred and any notes about assumptions made.
