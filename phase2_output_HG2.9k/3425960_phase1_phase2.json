Here is the JSON object that you requested:

Explanation:
The JSON object has three main fields: `python_version`, `dependencies`, and `requirements.txt`.

* The `python_version` field contains information about the minimum and maximum Python version required based on the extracted APIs. In this case, the minimum Python version is 3.6, and the maximum Python version is 3.7. The evidence for these values is provided in the `evidence` field as a list of statements linking API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used in the codebase. For each package, we provide the inferred version range based on the extracted APIs. In this case, we have three packages: `AppKit`, `Application`, and `Applications`. For `AppKit`, we can't determine an upper bound (maximum Python version) for the package, so we indicate null. The other two packages have a known upper and lower bound based on the extracted APIs.
* The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for each dependency. In this case, we provide one line per package with the inferred version range.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to adjust the values based on your specific use case.
