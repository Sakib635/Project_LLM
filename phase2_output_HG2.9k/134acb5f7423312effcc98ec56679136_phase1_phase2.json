Here is the final JSON object based on the provided extracted APIs:

{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "y",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python y → min Python y"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "requirements.txt": []
}

The JSON object contains the following information:

* python_version: The minimum and maximum Python version required for the project, based on the extracted APIs provided.
* dependencies: A list of external packages used in the project, with their inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence (list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions), confidence (0.0–1.0), and notes (optional assumptions).
* requirements.txt: A list of all dependencies' recommended_requirements_line.

Note that the JSON object does not contain any information about the external packages used in the project, as none were provided in the input prompt.
