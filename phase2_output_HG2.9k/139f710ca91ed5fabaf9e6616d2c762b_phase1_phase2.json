### Python Version

The minimum Python version required for the code is **3.6**, as it uses the `typing` module which was introduced in Python 3.5 and the `dataclass` decorator which was introduced in Python 3.6.

The maximum Python version allowed is **null**, as there are no known compatibility issues with newer versions of Python.

### Dependency Versions

For the dependencies, we can safely infer that the minimum version required for `gensim` is **4.0**, as the `word2vec` module was introduced in that version.

The maximum version allowed for `gensim` is also **null**, as there are no known compatibility issues with newer versions of the package.

For `sklearn`, we can infer that the minimum version required is **0.24.0**, as the `neighbors.KDTree` class was introduced in that version.

The maximum version allowed for `sklearn` is also **null**, as there are no known compatibility issues with newer versions of the package.

### requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following lines:
```
gensim>=4.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
```
This is because the minimum and maximum versions for both dependencies are **null**, indicating that there are no known compatibility issues with newer versions of the packages.
