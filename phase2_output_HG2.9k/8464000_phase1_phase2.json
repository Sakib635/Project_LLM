The resulting JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: Contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided. In this case, the minimum version is 3.6 and the maximum version is 4.0.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary containing information about each dependency package used in the code. Each entry in the dictionary contains the following information:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: The inferred version range for the package based on the extracted APIs provided. In this case, the package's minimum version is 5.12.0 and the maximum version is 6.0.0.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: A recommended requirements line that can be used in a `requirements.txt` file for the package. In this case, the recommended requirements line is `PySide.QtCore>=5.12.0,<6.0.0`.
	+ `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. In this case, the evidence statement for `PySide.QtCore` is "QTimer introduced in PySide.QtCore 5.12.0", while the evidence statement for `PySide.QtGui` is "QImage introduced in PySide.QtGui 5.12.0".
	+ `confidence`: A float value indicating the confidence level of the inferred version range (0.0-1.0). In this case, the confidence level for both packages is 0.7, indicating that there is a high degree of certainty in the inferred version range.
	+ `notes`: Any additional notes or assumptions related to the package and its version range. In this case, there are no additional notes or assumptions.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines that can be used in a `requirements.txt` file for all dependencies. In this case, the recommended requirements line is `PySide.QtCore>=5.12.0,<6.0.0`, `PySide.QtGui>=5.12.0,<6.0.0`, and `cv2>=4.5.3,<4.6.0`.
