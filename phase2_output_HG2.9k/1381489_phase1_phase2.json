Here is the final JSON object:
```json

  },

      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Note that the JSON object includes the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required or allowed for the project, based on the extracted APIs provided. The `min` field is null if there is no reliable upper bound, while the `max` field is null if there is no reliable lower bound. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, and the `notes` field includes any optional assumptions.
* `dependencies`: an object containing the inferred version ranges for each external package used, as well as the recommended requirements line for each dependency. The `inferred_version_range` field is null if there is no reliable upper or lower bound, while the `recommended_requirements_line` field is null if there is no recommendation. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, and the `confidence` field indicates the level of confidence in the inferred version range. The `notes` field includes any optional assumptions or conflicting APIs.
* `requirements.txt`: an array containing the recommended requirements line for all dependencies. This is generated by concatenating the `recommended_requirements_line` field for each dependency.
