The output JSON object contains the following fields:

* python_version: This field contains information about the Python version range based on the extracted APIs provided.
	+ min: The minimum Python version required for the project.
	+ max: The maximum Python version allowed for the project, or null if none is specified.
	+ evidence: A list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
	+ notes: Optional assumptions about the Python version range inferred from the extracted APIs.
* dependencies: This field contains information about each external package used in the project, including its inferred version range and recommended requirements line.
	+ <package>: A dictionary containing information about a specific external package used in the project.
		- inferred_version_range: A string representing the inferred version range of the package based on the extracted APIs provided. For example, ">=1.2.0,<3.0.0" or null if none can be determined.
		- recommended_requirements_line: A string representing the recommended requirements line for the package, or null if none is specified. For example, "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0".
		- evidence: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
		- confidence: A number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the level of confidence in the inferred version range for this package.
		- notes: Optional assumptions or conflicting APIs about the package's version requirements.
* requirements.txt: An array of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies, which can be used to generate a requirements file.

The output JSON object is valid JSON and follows the schema outlined above.
