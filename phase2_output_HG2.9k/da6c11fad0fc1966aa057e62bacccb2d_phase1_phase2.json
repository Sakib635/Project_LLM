Note: The output is a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "<Python version>",
    "max": "<Python version>",
    "evidence": [<list of evidence statements>],
    "notes": "<optional notes>"
  },

    "<package>": {
      "inferred_version_range": "<version range string>", or null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": "<requirements line string>",
      "evidence": [<list of evidence statements>],
      "confidence": <0.0–1.0>,
      "notes": "<optional notes>"
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [<list of requirements lines>]
}
The JSON object has the following fields:
* python_version: an object with the following fields:
	+ min: the minimum Python version required (as a string).
	+ max: the maximum Python version allowed, or null if there is no upper bound (as a string).
	+ evidence: a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
	+ notes: optional assumptions or notes about the Python version range.
* dependencies: an object with the following fields for each package used:
	+ inferred_version_range: a string representing the best estimate of the required version range, or null if it cannot be determined (e.g., ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0").
	+ recommended_requirements_line: a string representing the recommended requirements line for this package, or null if there is no recommended requirements line.
	+ evidence: a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ confidence: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the level of confidence in the inferred version range.
	+ notes: optional assumptions, conflicting APIs, uncertain items, or other notes about this package.
* requirements.txt: an array of strings representing each dependencies' recommended_requirements_line (e.g., ["pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"]).
