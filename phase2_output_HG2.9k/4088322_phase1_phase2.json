Here is the JSON object based on the provided extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "y",
    "max": "x",
    "evidence": ["openkm.client.Client added in Python y → min Python y", "time.clock removed in Python x→ max Python z"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "openkm.client": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],

    },
    "openkm.options.cache": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["openkm.options.cache.clear introduced in v1.2.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,

    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
In this JSON object:

* The `python_version` field contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided.
* The `dependencies` field contains a dictionary of external package names as keys and their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines as values. The `inferred_version_range` field specifies the range of versions that were inferred to be used based on the extracted APIs, while the `recommended_requirements_line` field provides a recommended requirements line for each dependency.
* The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. The `confidence` field specifies the confidence level of each dependency version range, with higher values indicating more confidence in the inference. The `notes` field can optionally contain additional information or assumptions.
* The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
