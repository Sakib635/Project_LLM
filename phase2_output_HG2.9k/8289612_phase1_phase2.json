Here is the final JSON object:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.6 → min Python 3.6", "time.clock removed in Python 3.7→ max Python"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pandas": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "pandas>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["pandas.DataFrame added in v1.0.0", "pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy added in v1.0.0", "pandas.DataFrame.ix deprecated in v1.0.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "numpy>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["numpy.array added in v1.0.0", "numpy.linalg.norm added in v1.0.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "pandas>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
Note that the JSON object has a "python_version" field containing information about the minimum and maximum Python versions required by the code, based on the extracted APIs provided. The "dependencies" field contains an object for each external package used in the code, with information about its inferred version range (if any), recommended requirements line (if any), evidence linking APIs to introduction, deprecation, or removal, confidence level, and notes. Finally, the "requirements.txt" field contains a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.
