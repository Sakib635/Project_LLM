The output includes the following fields:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions required or allowed based on the extracted APIs provided.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of package names with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. If a package does not have any inferred version range, then it is set to null. If a package has no recommended requirements line, then it is set to null as well.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines.

The output includes the following evidence for each dependency:

* `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.

For example, "API X introduced in Python y → min Python y" or "API X removed in Python x → max Python z".

The output also includes the following confidence scores for each dependency:

* `confidence`: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident the assistant is about its inferences.

For example, a confidence score of 1.0 indicates that the assistant has high confidence in its inferences.

The output also includes the following notes for each dependency:

* `notes`: Optional assumptions or conflicting APIs.
