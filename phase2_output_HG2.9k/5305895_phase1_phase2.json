Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.6 â†’ min Python 3.6"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "Pygame": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "Pygame>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["pygame.init introduced in version 1.2.0", "pygame.display.set_mode introduced in version 1.2.0"],
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": ["Pygame>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"]
}
```
In this JSON object, the `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.6, and there is no upper bound on the maximum Python version. The `dependencies` field contains a list of dependencies with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies with their recommended requirements lines.

The `Pygame` dependency has an inferred version range of `>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`, which is based on the APIs that were extracted from the code. The `recommended_requirements_line` field contains the same information as the `inferred_version_range` field, but in a more human-readable format. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping the APIs to their introduction, deprecation, or removal versions. The `confidence` field indicates the confidence level of the inference (in this case, 0.85). Finally, the `notes` field is empty as there are no conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items.
