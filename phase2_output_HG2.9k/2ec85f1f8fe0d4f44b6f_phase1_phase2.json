Note: The "confidence" field in the dependencies dictionary represents the degree of confidence in the inferred version range for each package.
The value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a high level of certainty in the inference result.
In this example, the confidence value for xsel is set to 0.5 because while we have seen its usage in the code, we cannot determine its version range with complete certainty.
Also, the "notes" field provides additional information about the inference results, such as the assumption that the package's version range depends on the Python version.
Finally, the "requirements.txt" field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, in the format of "<package>=<version>,<comparator>".
