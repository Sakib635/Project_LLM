Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["hug.get added in Python 3.6 → min Python 3.6"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "text": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "text>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["echo(text) added in text 1.2.0 → recommended requirements line"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "locals": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["Echo: {text} introduced in locals"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": ["text>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"]
}
```
Note that the minimum Python version is set to `3.6` based on the evidence of `hug.get` being added in this version. The maximum Python version is set to null because there is no evidence of any Python version removal or deprecation for the APIs listed in the provided input.

The dependency inference for `text` is based on the evidence of `echo(text)` being introduced in version 1.2.0 and the recommended requirements line being `text>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`. The confidence level for this package is set to 0.9.

The dependency inference for `locals` is based on the evidence of `Echo: {text}` being introduced in locals, and the recommended requirements line is not provided because it's not possible to infer a specific version range for this package. The confidence level for this package is set to 0.8.

The `requirements.txt` field contains only one dependency with a recommended requirements line for `text`.
