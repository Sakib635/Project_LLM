The provided extracted APIs are:
```json
{
  "theano": ["theano.shared", "theano.tensor"],
  "lasagne": ["lasagne.updates.adam"],
  "sklearn": ["sklearn.datasets.fetch_mldata", "sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split", "sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder"],
  "numpy": ["numpy.float32", "numpy.int32", "numpy.asarray", "numpy.random.normal", "numpy.reshape", "numpy.count_nonzero", "numpy.ravel"],
  "builtins": ["range", "xrange"]
}
```
Based on the extracted APIs, we can infer the following:

Python version range:

* Minimum Python version required: 3.6
* Maximum Python version allowed: null (since there are no APIs that indicate a maximum version)
* Evidence: The minimum Python version required is inferred based on the use of `theano` and `lasagne`, which were introduced in Python 3.6.

External packages:

* numpy:
	+ Inferred version range: >=1.18.0,<2.0.0 (based on usage)
	+ Recommended requirements line: "numpy>=1.18.0,<2.0.0"
	+ Evidence: The use of `numpy.float32`, `numpy.int32`, and other numeric APIs indicate a minimum version requirement of 1.18.0.
* sklearn:
	+ Inferred version range: >=0.20.0,<2.0.0 (based on usage)
	+ Recommended requirements line: "sklearn>=0.20.0,<2.0.0"
	+ Evidence: The use of `sklearn.datasets.fetch_mldata` and other APIs indicate a minimum version requirement of 0.20.0.
* builtins:
	+ Inferred version range: null (since there are no APIs that indicate a maximum version)
	+ Recommended requirements line: null (since there is no recommended version)
	+ Evidence: The use of `range` and `xrange` indicates no maximum version requirement.
