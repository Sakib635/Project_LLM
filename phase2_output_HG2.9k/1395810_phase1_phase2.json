  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "google-appengine>=1.9.65",

  ]
}
```
Note that the `python_version` field indicates that the project requires Python versions greater than or equal to 3.6, and the `dependencies` field lists the inferred version ranges for each external package used, along with their corresponding recommended requirements lines. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies required by the project, in the form of their recommended requirements lines.
