This JSON object includes the following information:

* The minimum and maximum Python versions required for the project based on the extracted APIs.
* The inferred version range for each external package used based on the extracted APIs.
* A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies in requirements.txt format.
* Evidence for the inferences, including links to official Python documentation or other sources.
* Confidence scores for the inferences, ranging from 0.0 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence).
