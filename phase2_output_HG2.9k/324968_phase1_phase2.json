Here is the JSON object that meets your specifications:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.7",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.8"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.20.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["numpy.random.rand added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "pandas": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["pandas.read_csv added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0",
    "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
Note that this JSON object includes the following information:

* The Python version range inferred from the extracted APIs is `3.7` to `null`, with evidence pointing to the removal of `time.clock` in Python 3.8.
* For each external package, I have included the inferred version range (if any), the recommended requirements line (if any), and the confidence score for each dependency.
* The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies with their recommended requirements lines.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with other JSON objects.
