  "python_version": {

  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "requirements.txt": []
}

The JSON object returned follows the schema provided, with empty fields for "python_version" and "dependencies". The "requirements.txt" field is also an empty array, as no external packages were provided in the user prompt.

It's important to note that the absence of any Python version range or evidence for the external package inferences means that there is insufficient information to make such inferences, and therefore those fields are left blank.
