    "scipy>=1.3.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}

The JSON object includes the following fields:

* python_version: Contains information about the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs. The min field represents the earliest version of Python in which all extracted APIs were available, while the max field represents the latest version of Python where all extracted APIs are still valid. The evidence field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, and the notes field provides additional information or assumptions.
* dependencies: A dictionary that contains an entry for each third-party package used in the project, along with its inferred version range and recommended requirements line. The inferred version range is a string representing the minimum and maximum versions of the package that are required based on the extracted APIs, while the recommended requirements line is a string representing the version requirement that should be added to the requirements.txt file for this package. The evidence field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, and the confidence field represents the level of confidence in the inferred version range (0.0–1.0). The notes field provides additional information or assumptions.
* requirements.txt: A list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.
