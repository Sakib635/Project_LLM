Note that the `python_version` field indicates that the minimum required Python version is 3.6, while the `dependencies` field contains information about the version ranges for each package used in the project, as well as recommendations for their requirements lines. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies and their recommended version ranges, which can be used to create a requirements file for the project.
