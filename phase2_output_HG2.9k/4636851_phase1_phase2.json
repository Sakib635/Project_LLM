Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.7",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["bpy.context.window_manager.keyconfigs.default added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "bpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["bpy.ops.text.new added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "bpy_extras": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["bpy_extras.keyconfig_utils.keyconfig_export added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
In this output, we can see that the minimum Python version required is 3.7, as indicated by the `min` field in the `python_version` object. The `max` field is null, indicating that there is no upper limit on the maximum Python version that can be used for this project.

For each dependency, we have an entry in the `dependencies` object with its name as the key and various properties about it as its value. In this case, we have two dependencies: `bpy` and `bpy_extras`. For `bpy`, we can see that there is no inferred version range for this dependency, as the only API call listed (`bpy.ops.text.new`) was added in Python 3.7, which is the minimum required version for this project. Therefore, the recommended requirements line for this dependency is null.

Similarly, for `bpy_extras`, we can see that there is no inferred version range and recommended requirements line, as all API calls listed were added in Python 3.7, which is the minimum required version for this project.

Finally, the `requirements.txt` field contains an empty list of dependencies, as there are no third-party packages used in this project that have their own version ranges.
