This JSON object is the final output, which contains the following information:

* `python_version`: an object that describes the inferred Python version range based on the extracted APIs provided.
	+ `min`: the minimum Python version required (null if unknown).
	+ `max`: the maximum Python version allowed (null if none).
	+ `evidence`: a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
	+ `notes`: optional assumptions.
* `dependencies`: an object that contains inferred information for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided.
	+ `<package>`: an object that describes the inferred version range and recommended requirements line for a specific package.
		- `inferred_version_range`: a string representing the inferred version range (e.g., ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0") or null if unknown.
		- `recommended_requirements_line`: a string representing the recommended requirements line for a specific package (e.g., "pkg>=1.2.0,<2.0.0") or null if unknown.
		- `evidence`: a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
		- `confidence`: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the confidence in the inferred version range and recommended requirements line (higher is better).
		- `notes`: optional: conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items.
* `requirements.txt`: an array of strings representing the required packages and their versions according to the best-effort inference.
