Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.6 â†’ min Python 3.6"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "tensorflow": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Explanation:

* The Python version range is inferred to be "3.6" since `pathlib.Path` was added in Python 3.6 and there are no conflicting APIs or assumptions that would cause it to be higher or lower than that.
* No external packages are used, so their versions are set to null.
* The `requirements.txt` field is empty since no third-party packages were found in the extracted APIs.
