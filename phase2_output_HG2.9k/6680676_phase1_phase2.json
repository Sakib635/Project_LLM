Here is the final JSON object:

    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "disco>=1.0.0,<2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
The JSON object contains the following information:
* python_version: null (no reliable upper or lower bound could be determined)
* dependencies: a list of dictionaries with each dictionary representing an external package dependency
	+ inferred_version_range: ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0" for disco and ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0" for numpy
	+ recommended_requirements_line: the same as the inferred version range for each package
	+ evidence: a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions for each package
	+ confidence: 1.0 for both packages
	+ notes: empty string for both packages
* requirements.txt: a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies (["disco>=1.0.0,<2.0.0", "numpy>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"])
