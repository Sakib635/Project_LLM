This JSON output provides the following information:

* The Python version range (min, max) is [3.7, null), indicating that Python 3.7 or later versions are required.
* For each external package, we have provided the inferred version range (>=1.20.0,<2.0.0) and recommended requirements line (numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0) based on the extracted APIs provided.
* We also provide evidence to support our conclusions, such as the introduction or deprecation of an API in a specific version.
* The confidence score is 0.8 for each package, indicating that our inference is relatively certain.
* Finally, we have included all required dependencies in requirements.txt.
