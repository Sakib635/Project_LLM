Here is the JSON object that meets your requirements:

{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.5",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.5 → min Python 3.5", "time.clock removed in Python 3.7→ max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "networkx": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["networkx.Graph introduced in Python 3.5"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.9,<2",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "numpy>=1.9,<2",
      "evidence": ["numpy.sum introduced in Python 3.5", "numpy.float introduced in Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "scipy": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2,<2",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "scipy>=1.2,<2",
      "evidence": ["scipy.integrate.quad introduced in Python 3.5"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "networkx>=1.9,<2",
    "numpy>=1.9,<2",
    "scipy>=1.2,<2"
  ]
}

The JSON object has the following structure:

* `python_version`: This field contains information about the minimum and maximum Python versions required for the project.
* `dependencies`: This field contains a list of dependencies (packages) used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines.
* `requirements.txt`: This field contains a list of all the dependencies' recommended requirements lines, formatted as a string.

The JSON object is structured according to your requirements and follows the schema you provided.

Note that this JSON object is only an example, and the actual output may vary depending on the specific APIs and Python versions used in the project.
