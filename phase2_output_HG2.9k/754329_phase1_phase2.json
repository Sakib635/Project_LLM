Here is the final JSON object for the provided `extracted_APIs`:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.7",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["DjangoAuthentication added in Python 3.7 â†’ min Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pandas": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["pandas.DataFrame introduced in pandas 1.2.0", "pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy introduced in pandas 1.2.0", "pandas.DataFrame.ix deprecated in pandas 2.0.0"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["numpy.array introduced in numpy 1.2.0", "numpy.linalg.norm introduced in numpy 1.2.0"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": ["pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0", "numpy>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"]
}
```
The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.7 and there are no upper bounds on the maximum Python version.
The `dependencies` field lists the external packages used in the code and their inferred version ranges, along with evidence for each API introduced, deprecated, or removed in those versions. The `recommended_requirements_line` field provides a more specific version range for each package, which is based on the minimum and maximum versions found in the evidence.
The `requirements.txt` field lists all dependencies with their recommended requirements lines, which are used to generate the `pip install` command.

Note that this JSON object is only an example and may not accurately reflect the actual version ranges required for the code you are analyzing. The confidence values in the evidence statements are based on the similarity of the API names and the timing of their introduction, deprecation, or removal, but they may not always be accurate.

Also note that this is a simplified example, in real-world scenarios there can be more APIs, multiple packages with different versions and conflicting dependencies, and other factors that can affect the accuracy of the version inference results.
