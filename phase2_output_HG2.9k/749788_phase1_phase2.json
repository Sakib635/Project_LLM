Here's the final JSON object:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": null,
    "max": null,
    "evidence": [],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {},
  "requirements.txt": []
}

The Python version range is unknown due to the lack of information about the versions used. Additionally, there is no external package mentioned in the input. Therefore, the output contains only the JSON object for the Python version range and an empty list for the requirements.txt file.
