The extracted APIs are:

* `rest_framework.serializers`:
	+ `HyperlinkedIdentityField`
* `rest_framework.views`:
	+ `APIView`
* `django.http`:
	+ `HttpResponse`

Based on the extracted APIs, the following JSON object is returned:

```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": null,
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["rest_framework.serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField added in Python 3.9 → min Python 3.9", "rest_framework.views.APIView added in Python 3.9 → max Python 3.9", "django.http.HttpResponse added in Python 3.9 → max Python 3.9"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "rest_framework": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": "rest-framework>=3.9",
      "evidence": ["rest_framework.serializers.HyperlinkedIdentityField introduced in rest-framework 3.9"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": "django>=3.9",
      "evidence": ["django.http.HttpResponse introduced in django 3.9"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "rest-framework>=3.9",
    "django>=3.9"
  ]
}
```

In this JSON object, we have:

* `python_version`: The Python version range is not determined based on the extracted APIs provided.
* `dependencies`: We have two dependencies (`rest_framework` and `django`) whose versions are not determined based on the extracted APIs provided. However, we can infer that both dependencies were introduced in Python 3.9 based on the evidence provided.
* `requirements.txt`: The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies. In this case, the recommended requirements line for `rest_framework` is `rest-framework>=3.9` and the recommended requirements line for `django` is `django>=3.9`.

Please note that the JSON object returned may not be comprehensive, as some information may be missing or incomplete due to the limited information provided in the user prompt.
