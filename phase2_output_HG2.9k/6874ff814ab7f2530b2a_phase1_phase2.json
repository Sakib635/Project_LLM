Here is the JSON object that corresponds to the input API call extraction:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.5",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["GstObject.GetChildMemberWithName added in Python 3.5 â†’ min Python 3.5"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pandas": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The output JSON object includes the following fields:

1. `python_version`: This field contains information about the Python version range based on the extracted APIs provided. The minimum Python version required is set to `3.5`, and there is no maximum Python version allowed (`max` field is set to null). The evidence for this decision includes the fact that `GstObject.GetChildMemberWithName` was added in Python 3.5, which suggests that this API call is most likely related to Python 3.5 or later.
2. `dependencies`: This field contains information about each external package used in the project and its version range. The `pandas` package is listed under this field, but no version range is inferred for it because there is not enough information in the input data to make a reliable inference. The `recommended_requirements_line` field is also set to null for this package, as there is not enough information in the input data to generate a recommended version requirement line.
3. `requirements.txt`: This field contains a list of all external packages used in the project and their recommended requirements lines. Since no version range can be inferred for the `pandas` package, its recommended requirements line is also set to null.

Note that this JSON object only includes the minimum Python version required (`3.5`) and the recommended requirements lines for each external package. If you need more detailed information about the Python version and external packages used in the project, you may want to use a different tool or approach.
