    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "idc>=6.8.0",
    "MemoryPattern>=1.2.0"
  ]
}
```
The JSON object includes the following information:

* The minimum and maximum Python versions required, based on the extracted APIs provided.
* The most likely version range for each external package used, based on the extracted APIs provided.
* The recommended requirements line for all dependencies, including third-party packages.
* Evidence of the API usage and its relationship to the Python version.
* Confidence in the inference, ranging from 0.0 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence).
* Notes, which can include conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items.

The JSON object adheres to the schema provided and is human-readable formatted with two spaces of indentation.
