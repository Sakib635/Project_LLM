Here is the JSON object that satisfies the requirements:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "y",
    "max": "x",
    "evidence": ["drawBot.ui.DrawView added in Python y → min Python y"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "drawBot": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "vanilla": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "vanilla>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["vanilla.Window added in Python y → min Python y"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "drawBot>=y,<x",
    "vanilla>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is y and the maximum Python version allowed is x. The `evidence` field contains a short statement linking the stdlib API usage to the Python version addition/removal.

The `dependencies` field lists the external packages used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. For example, the `drawBot` package has an inferred version range of null and a recommended requirements line of null because it does not have any extracted APIs. The `vanilla` package has an inferred version range of ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0" and a recommended requirements line of "vanilla>=1.2.0,<2.0.0". The `evidence` field contains a short statement linking the API usage to the introduction/deprecation versions.

The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all required dependencies, along with their recommended requirements lines.
