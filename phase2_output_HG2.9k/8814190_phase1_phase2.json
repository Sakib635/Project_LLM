Note: This JSON object only contains the information related to the Python version and external packages' versions that are inferred from the extracted APIs. The final requirements.txt file can be generated by concatenating all the recommended_requirements_line fields in the dependencies section, separated by newlines.

Please note that this is a sample output, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific use case.
