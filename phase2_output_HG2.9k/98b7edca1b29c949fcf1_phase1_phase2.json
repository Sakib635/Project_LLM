  ]
}
```
Explanation:

* The Python version range is between 3.5 and the latest version (Python 3.9) that has `argparse.ArgumentParser` available.
* For NumPy, we can infer a version range of ">=1.20,<2.0" because it was introduced in NumPy 1.20.0 and is considered deprecated in Python 3.8.
* For OpenCV, we cannot infer a version range as it has been removed in Python 3.9.
* The `requirements.txt` file contains the recommended requirement lines for both NumPy and OpenCV.
