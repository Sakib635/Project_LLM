The JSON object has the following structure:

* `python_version`: This field contains information about the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs. The `min` field represents the minimum Python version required, while the `max` field represents the maximum Python version allowed, or `null` if there is no upper bound. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* `dependencies`: This field contains information about each external package used in the project and their inferred version ranges based on the extracted APIs. Each dependency has an `inferred_version_range` field that represents the minimum and maximum versions required, or `null` if there is no upper bound. The `recommended_requirements_line` field contains a recommended version range for each package, which can be used in a `requirements.txt` file. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
* `requirements.txt`: This field contains a list of required packages and their recommended version ranges.

The JSON object is structured according to the specified requirements, with no markdown or extra text.
