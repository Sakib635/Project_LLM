Note: The above JSON object is just an example and may not accurately reflect the version requirements for a specific project. Also, note that the confidence value for each dependency is set to 1.0, which means there is no uncertainty in the inference results. In real-world scenarios, the confidence value may vary depending on the complexity of the project and the amount of available information.
