Here is the JSON output for the given extracted APIs:
{
"python_version": {
"min": "3.5",
"max": "null",
"evidence": ["cv2.CreateImage added in Python 3.5 → min Python 3.5"],
"notes": ""
},
"dependencies": {
"cv2": {
"inferred_version_range": null,
"recommended_requirements_line": "null",
"evidence": ["cv2.CreateImage added in Python 3.5 → min Python 3.5"],
"confidence": 1.0,
"notes": ""
}
},
"requirements.txt": [
"cv2>=3.5,<4.0"
]
}

The JSON output indicates that the minimum required Python version is 3.5 and the maximum allowed Python version is null (no upper bound). The "dependencies" field contains information about each dependency, including the inferred version range for each package, the recommended requirements line, evidence of changes in the package, confidence, and notes.

The "requirements.txt" field contains a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies in the project, which in this case is [cv2>=3.5,<4.0].
