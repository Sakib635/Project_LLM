Here is the JSON object that meets your requirements:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.0",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["argparse added in Python 3.0 → min Python 3.0", "shutil.move removed in Python 3.5→ max Python 3.8"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "urllib.request": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.24,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "urllib.request>=1.24,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["urllib.request.urlopen added in Python 3.0 → min Python 3.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "zipfile": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.24,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "zipfile>=1.24,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["zipfile.ZipFile added in Python 3.0 → min Python 3.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "urllib.request>=1.24,<2.0",
    "zipfile>=1.24,<2.0"
  ]
}
```
This JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object that specifies the minimum and maximum Python versions required by the project. The `min` field indicates the earliest Python version in which all the APIs listed in the `extracted_APIs` were available, while the `max` field indicates the latest Python version in which they are still available.
* `dependencies`: an object that contains a list of dependencies and their version ranges inferred from the extracted APIs. Each dependency has the following fields:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: the version range inferred for the dependency based on the extracted APIs, or null if it is not possible to determine a reliable upper or lower bound. The version range is represented as a string in the format ">=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C".
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: a recommended requirement line for the dependency, which can be used in a requirements file to specify its version range. If null, no specific version range is recommended.
	+ `evidence`: a list of short statements that link APIs to Python versions where they were introduced, deprecated, removed or changed.
	+ `confidence`: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the confidence in the inferred version range. A higher confidence indicates a more reliable inference.
	+ `notes`: optional notes about any assumptions made during inference.
* `requirements.txt`: an array of recommended requirement lines for all dependencies, which can be used in a requirements file to specify their version ranges.

Please note that this is just an example and the actual JSON object will depend on the specific APIs extracted from the codebase.
