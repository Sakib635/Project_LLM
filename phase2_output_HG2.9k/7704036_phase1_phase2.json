Here is the final JSON object based on the provided extracted APIs:
```json

  ]
}
```
Explanation:

* For Python version range, we can infer that the minimum required version is 3.6 based on the presence of `base64.b64decode` API in extracted APIs. The maximum version is unknown as there are no clear indicators of its removal or deprecation in any version.
* For dependencies, we have two packages: `django.core.files.base` and `rest_framework`. For `django.core.files.base`, we can infer that the minimum required version is 1.2.0 based on the presence of `ContentFile` API in extracted APIs. The maximum required version is unknown as there are no clear indicators of its removal or deprecation in any version.
For `rest_framework`, we can only infer that it was introduced in Django Rest Framework 3.8 based on the presence of `serializers` API in extracted APIs, but we cannot determine a specific version range for this package as there is no clear indicators of its removal or deprecation in any version.
* For requirements.txt, we have two packages: `django-core-files-base` and `rest-framework`. We recommend using the latest versions available at the time of writing, which are 1.2.0 for `django.core.files.base` and 3.8 for `rest_framework`.

Note that this is a conservative estimate based on the information provided in the extracted APIs, but it may not be the most up-to-date or accurate.
