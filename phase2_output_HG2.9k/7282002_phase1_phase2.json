Note that the `python_version` field indicates the minimum required Python version (3.5) and the maximum allowed Python version is not specified. The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used in the code, with the `inferred_version_range` field indicating the most likely version range for each package based on the extracted APIs provided. The `recommended_requirements_line` field provides a recommended requirements line for each package that can be added to the `requirements.txt` file. The `evidence` field contains short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, and the `confidence` field indicates the level of confidence in the inferred version range.
