Here's the final JSON object:
```json

  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["time.sleep added in Python 3.6 → min Python 3.6"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "flask": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "flask>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["Flask introduced in version 1.2 → min Flask 1.2.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,

    },
    "twython": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["Twython introduced in version 3.6 → min Twython 3.6"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "flask>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
    "twython>=3.6.0,<4.0.0"
  ]
}
```
In this JSON object, the `python_version` field contains the inferred minimum and maximum Python version ranges based on the extracted APIs. The `dependencies` field contains an array of objects for each external package used in the project, with their inferred version range (or null if it cannot be determined) and recommended requirements line (or null if none). The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines, formatted as strings.
