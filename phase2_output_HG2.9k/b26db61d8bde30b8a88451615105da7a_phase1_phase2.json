In this JSON object, we have:

* `python_version` contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided. The evidence is a list of statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal. The notes field is empty since there are no assumptions.
* `dependencies` is a dictionary where each key is a package name, and its value contains information about that package's inferred version range (if any), recommended requirements line (if any), evidence of the API usage leading to the inference of version range or recommended requirement line, confidence in the inference, and notes.
* `requirements.txt` is a list of recommended requirement lines for all dependencies.

Note that this JSON object only contains the final inferences and does not contain any intermediate steps or explanations.
