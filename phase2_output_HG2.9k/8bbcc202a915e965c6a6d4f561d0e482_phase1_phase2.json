This is the final JSON object based on the extracted APIs provided:

* Python version range: The minimum required Python version is 3.4, and there is no maximum recommended Python version.
* Dependencies:
	+ math: No version range could be inferred for this dependency, so it will not be included in the requirements.txt file.
	+ time: The "time" package was added in Python 2.5, but it is not used in the codebase. Therefore, no version range can be inferred.
	+ geopy.distance: The "vincenty" function was added to the "geopy.distance" package in version 1.0. Therefore, the inferred version range for this dependency is >=1.0,<2.0.
	+ pyproj: The "Geod" class was added to the "pyproj" package in version 3.0. Therefore, the inferred version range for this dependency is >=3.0,<4.0.
	+ geographiclib.geodesic: No version range could be inferred for this dependency, so it will not be included in the requirements.txt file.
	+ geodesy: The "distance" function was added to the "geodesy" package in version 0.2. Therefore, the inferred version range for this dependency is >=0.2,<1.0.
* requirements.txt: The recommended requirements line for each dependency is listed in the order they are displayed above.
