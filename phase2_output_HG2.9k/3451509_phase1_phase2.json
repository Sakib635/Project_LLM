  },

}
```
Please note that this JSON object does not contain any information about the Python version range, as it is not possible to infer a reliable version range based on the extracted APIs provided.
Also, since there are no third-party packages used in the code snippet, the "requirements.txt" field is empty.
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
