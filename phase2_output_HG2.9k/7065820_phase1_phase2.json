Here's the JSON output for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.6",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.6 â†’ min Python 3.6"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "os": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "sys": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,

      "notes": ""
    },
    "struct": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,

    },
    "Image": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "open": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON output includes the following fields:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs, along with evidence and notes.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary containing information about each external package used in the project, including their inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence, and notes. If a package is not used in the project, it will have an empty dictionary as its value.
* `requirements.txt`: An array of required packages with their recommended versions, if any.

Note that some packages may not have explicit version requirements or require different versions for different Python versions, which would be indicated by `null` for the inferred version range and `null` for the recommended requirements line.
