This JSON object includes the following information:

* The Python version range that is required to run the project, based on the extracted APIs provided. This is inferred as `3.0` with a minimum version of `3.4`.
* For each external package used in the project, the most likely version range that satisfies all of its dependencies and requirements. These version ranges are calculated using the evidence provided for each API usage in the extracted APIs.
* The list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies, based on the inferred version ranges.

Note that this JSON object is a summary of the inference results and does not include any additional information or assumptions beyond what was provided in the original prompt.
