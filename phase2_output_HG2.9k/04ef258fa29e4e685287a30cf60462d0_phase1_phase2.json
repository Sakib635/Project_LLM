Here is the JSON object for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.7",
    "max": null,
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "flotilla": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "flotilla>=1.0,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["Flotilla package introduced in Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "time": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["time.sleep added in Python 3.7 → min Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "flotilla>=1.0,<2.0",
    "time.sleep"
  ]
}
```
Note: The `python_version` object indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions that are required based on the extracted APIs. The `dependencies` object contains information about each package, including its inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence level, and any notes or assumptions made during inference. Finally, the `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
