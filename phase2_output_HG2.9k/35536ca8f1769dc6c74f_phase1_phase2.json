Note that this JSON object includes the following information:

* Python version range (minimum and maximum versions) based on extracted APIs.
* Inferred version ranges for each external package used based on extracted APIs.
* Recommended requirements lines for all dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

The fields have the following meanings:

* `python_version`: Minimum and maximum Python versions required or allowed, respectively. If there is no upper bound, it will be indicated by a null value.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of package names to their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. If the package has no dependencies, an empty string will be returned instead. The `inferred_version_range` field specifies the inferred range based on the extracted APIs, while the `recommended_requirements_line` field provides a specific requirements line for the package.
* `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to their introduction/deprecation versions or removal. The confidence level indicates how confident we are in our inference. If there is no upper bound, it will be indicated by a null value.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
