In the JSON output, the `python_version` field contains information about the minimum and maximum Python versions required to run the code based on the extracted APIs provided. The `dependencies` field contains a list of all third-party packages used in the code, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines.
