This JSON object meets the requirements you outlined:
1. It includes the minimum Python version (min) and maximum Python version (max) required to run the code.
2. For each external package used, it provides the inferred version range (inferred_version_range) and recommended requirements line (recommended_requirements_line).
3. It also includes a list of requirements for all dependencies (requirements.txt).
The structure of the JSON object is as follows:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "y",
    "max": "x",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python y → min Python y", "time.clock removed in Python x→ max Python z"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "<package>": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C" or null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": "pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C" or null,
      "evidence": ["API X introduced, depricated, removed or changed in vM.N.P"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C]
}
The output is human-readable and strictly follows the JSON schema.
