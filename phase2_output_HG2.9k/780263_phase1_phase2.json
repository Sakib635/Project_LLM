Here is the final JSON object:

    },
    "myapp": {

      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],

    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": ["django>=2.0.0,<3.0.0"]
}
```
This JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum Python version required is 3.6, with no upper bound (i.e., null). This is based on the fact that `time.clock` was removed in Python version 3.7.
* `dependencies`: A list of dependencies used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The dependency `django` has an inferred version range of `>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`, which is based on the fact that the `Permission` class was introduced in Django version 2.0.0. The `myapp` dependency does not have a recommended requirements line because no version ranges could be inferred for it.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, including `django`. This is based on the fact that the `Permission` class was introduced in Django version 2.0.0 and should be included in the project's requirements file.
