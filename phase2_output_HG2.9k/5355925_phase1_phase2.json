    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "numpy>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
Note that the JSON object contains:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions required, as well as evidence and notes for each version.
* `dependencies`: A list of external packages used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges (if available), recommended requirements lines, evidence, confidence scores, and notes.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
