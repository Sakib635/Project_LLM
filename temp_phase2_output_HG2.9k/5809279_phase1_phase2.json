The `python_version` field indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs, with evidence of how each version was added or removed in the form of a list of statements. The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used, including the inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence of introduction/deprecation of APIs, confidence, and notes. The `requirements.txt` field is an empty array as there are no third-party packages in this list of extracted APIs.
