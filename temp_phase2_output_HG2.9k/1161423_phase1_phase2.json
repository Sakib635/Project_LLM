Here is the JSON output for the provided extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "django>=1.2,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["QueryDict added in Django 1.2 → min Django 1.2", "multipartparser.MultiValueDict added in Django 1.4 → min Django 1.4"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The output includes the following information:

* Python version range (min and max): 3.4-3.7 based on stdlib APIs usage.
* Dependency inference for Django package: >=1.2,<2.0 based on stdlib APIs usage.
* Recommended requirements line for Django package: "django>=1.2,<2.0" based on the inferred version range.
* Evidence and confidence for each dependency: List of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. Confidence is always 1.0 for this example.
* Requirements.txt: An empty list because no third-party packages are used in this example.
