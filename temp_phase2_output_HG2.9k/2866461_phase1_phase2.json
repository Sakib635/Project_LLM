Note that the JSON object is based on the extracted APIs provided and does not include any assumptions or notes.
The Python version range inferred is [3.4, 3.7], and the dependencies are grouped by package and standard library (Python stdlib). The dependencies are ranked based on the confidence in each API's introduction/deprecation versions and the evidence provided for their inference.

The external packages used are: twisted, sys, os, subprocess, tempfile, cycriptbot, and cycriptbotfactory. For each package, the inferred version range is null, as it cannot be determined based on the extracted APIs. However, the recommended requirements line is provided for each package based on its API usage.

The requirements.txt file is empty, as there are no third-party packages used in the project.
