The final JSON object for the given extracted APIs is:

Explanation:

* `python_version`: The inferred Python version range is `3.4` to `3.7`, based on the fact that `pathlib.Path` was added in Python 3.4 and `time.clock` was removed in Python 3.8.
* `dependencies`: For each dependency, the inferred version range is `>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C`, where `X.Y.Z` is the earliest introduced version of the API and `A.B.C` is the latest version before deprecation or removal. The recommended requirements line is `pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C`.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty list, since there are no external packages used in this example.
