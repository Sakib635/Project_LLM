```
Explanation:
The minimum Python version required is 3.4 based on the presence of `pathlib.Path` in the list of extracted API calls. The maximum Python version allowed is 3.7 based on the removal of `time.clock` in Python 3.8.

For the external packages, we can infer that `pandas` has a minimum required version of 0.10.0 based on the presence of `pandas.DataFrame`, but there is no maximum recommended version as we cannot determine a reliable upper bound. Similarly, we can infer that `numpy` has a minimum required version of 1.8.0 based on the presence of `numpy.array`, but again there is no maximum recommended version as we cannot determine a reliable upper bound.

As for the `requirements.txt` field, since we are unable to determine the exact versions of the external packages used in the project, we leave it empty.
