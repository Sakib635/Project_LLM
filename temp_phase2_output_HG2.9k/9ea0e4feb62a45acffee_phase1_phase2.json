Here is the final JSON object:

```
This JSON object represents the inference results for the given extracted APIs. The `python_version` field indicates the minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib API usage. The `dependencies` field contains a dictionary of dependencies, where each dependency has an inferred version range and a recommended requirements line. The `requirements.txt` field is empty because no third-party packages were specified in the extracted APIs.

Note that the confidence for both dependencies is 0.5, indicating that there was not enough information to determine a reliable upper or lower bound for either dependency.
