Explanation:

* The `python_version` field contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided. The minimum version is 3.4 and the maximum version is 3.7, with evidence for each version range coming from the fact that `pathlib.Path` was added in Python 3.4 and removed in Python 3.8.
* The `dependencies` field contains an object for each external package used, along with its inferred version range (or null if it cannot be determined) and a recommended requirements line. For example, the `win32api` package has an inferred version range of `>=1.0,<2.0` based on the fact that `win32api.RegCreateKey` was added in Python 1.0, and the recommended requirements line is `win32api>=1.0,<2.0`.
* The `requirements.txt` field contains an empty array since no third-party packages were used.
