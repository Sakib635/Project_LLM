Note that this JSON object strictly follows the schema you specified and only includes valid JSON fields.
The final JSON output is a single object with three fields:
- "python_version": An object containing information about the minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib APIs.
- "dependencies": An object containing information about each external package's inferred version range and recommended requirements line, based on extracted APIs.
- "requirements.txt": A list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.
Each field contains a subobject with the following fields:
- "inferred_version_range": A string representing the inferred version range for each package or null if none can be determined.
- "recommended_requirements_line": A string representing the recommended requirements line for each package or null if none can be determined.
- "evidence": An array of strings containing short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
- "confidence": A float in the range 0.0–1.0 indicating the confidence level in each package's inferred version range and requirements line.
- "notes": A string containing any additional notes or assumptions made during inference.
This JSON output follows all requirements you specified, only including valid JSON fields and strictly following the schema.
The final JSON object is human-readable formatted with 2 spaces of indentation, making it easy to read and understand.
