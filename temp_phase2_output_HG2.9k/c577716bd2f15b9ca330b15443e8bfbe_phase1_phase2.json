The JSON object has the following fields:
* python_version: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the stdlib APIs.
* dependencies: an object containing information about each external package used, with the following fields for each package:
	+ inferred_version_range: a string representing the inferred version range for the package, or null if it cannot be determined.
	+ recommended_requirements_line: a string representing the recommended requirements line for the package, or null if it cannot be determined.
	+ evidence: an array of strings containing short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ confidence: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the confidence in the inferred version range and requirements line.
	+ notes: optional notes about the package, such as conflicting APIs or assumptions.
* requirements.txt: an array of strings containing the recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
