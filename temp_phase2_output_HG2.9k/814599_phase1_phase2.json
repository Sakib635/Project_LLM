```
The JSON object includes the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions required for the project based on the extracted APIs.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of package dependencies with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines.
	+ Each dependency has its own set of fields, including:
		- `inferred_version_range`: The inferred minimum and maximum versions required for the package based on the extracted APIs.
		- `recommended_requirements_line`: A recommended requirements line that can be used to install the package.
		- `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
		- `confidence`: A confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident the assistant is in its inference.
		- `notes`: Optional notes or assumptions.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, including third-party packages only.

Note that some dependencies may have null inferred version ranges, indicating that their versions cannot be reliably determined based on the extracted APIs. In these cases, the assistant will choose conservative ranges to ensure the project runs safely.
