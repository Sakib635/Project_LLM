Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "twisted": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=19.0.0,<20.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "twisted>=19.0.0,<20.0.0",
      "evidence": ["twisted.internet.reactor introduced in v19.0.0"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "sys": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["sys.argv introduced in Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.6,
      "notes": "The API sys.argv was removed in Python 3.8"
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "twisted>=19.0.0,<20.0.0",
    "sys==3.7"
  ]
}
```
Note that the inferred version range for the `sys` package is null because the API `sys.argv` was removed in Python 3.8 and cannot be used to determine the required version range. The recommended requirements line for this package is set to `sys==3.7` as a conservative estimate, but with low confidence.
