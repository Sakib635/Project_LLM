```
This JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs.
* `dependencies`: an object containing information about each package used in the project, including its inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence, and notes.
* `requirements.txt`: a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.

Note that the values for `inferred_version_range`, `recommended_requirements_line`, and `evidence` are based on the provided extracted APIs and may not be accurate or complete.
The confidence level is also an estimate and can vary depending on the specific use case and requirements of the project.

The JSON object meets the specified schema and follows the rules for outputting valid JSON.
