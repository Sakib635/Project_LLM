This JSON object has the following fields:
* python_version: The minimum and maximum Python versions required to run the code, with evidence for each version range.
* dependencies: A dictionary of all third-party packages used in the code, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. Each package has an "inferred_version_range" field with the range inferred from the extracted APIs, a "recommended_requirements_line" field with the recommended requirement line for the package, an "evidence" field containing short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, a "confidence" field indicating the confidence in each version range (0.0-1.0), and a "notes" field with any additional notes or assumptions.
* requirements.txt: An empty list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.
