Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "facepy": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.7.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "django>=1.7.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["Django introduced in version 1.7"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on standard library APIs.
* `dependencies`: a dictionary where each key is a package name, and each value is an object containing information about that package's version range, recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence, and notes.
* `requirements.txt`: an empty array as there are no third-party packages in the provided list of extracted APIs.
