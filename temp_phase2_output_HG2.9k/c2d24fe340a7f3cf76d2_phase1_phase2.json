Note that this JSON object is generated based on the extracted APIs and does not take into account any other factors that could affect the compatibility of the project with different Python versions.
The "python_version" field contains the inferred minimum and maximum Python version ranges based on the stdlib APIs used in the project. The "dependencies" field contains the inferred version range for each external package used, along with a recommended requirements line and evidence to support the inference. Finally, the "requirements.txt" field contains a list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines.
The confidence values indicate the level of certainty in the inference, with 1.0 indicating a very high degree of certainty and 0.0 indicating a very low degree of certainty. The notes field can include additional information or assumptions that may be relevant to the user.
In this case, we have inferred that PySpark requires Python 3.4-3.7 and that NumPy requires Python 1.14.0-2.0.0. We have also generated a requirements.txt file with the recommended versions for both dependencies.
It's important to note that these are only recommendations, and the actual version of the packages used in the project may be different than what is specified here.
