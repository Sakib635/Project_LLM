Here is the JSON object that meets the requirements:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cv2": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["cv2.normalize", "cv2.imwrite", "cv2.applyColorMap", "cv2.imshow", "cv2.waitKey", "cv2.putText"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": "No evidence of version-specific APIs."
    },
    "os": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["os.makedirs"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": "No evidence of version-specific APIs."
    },
    "time": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["time.time"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": "No evidence of version-specific APIs."
    },
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["numpy.array", "numpy.linalg.norm"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": "No evidence of version-specific APIs."
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
In this JSON object, I have included the following information:

1. The Python version range based on the extracted APIs provided. The minimum version is 3.4, and the maximum version is 3.7, with evidence of the addition/removal of specific Python versions.
2. For each external package used, the inferred version range (or null if none) and the recommended requirements line (or null if none). The confidence level is 0.5 for all packages, indicating that there is no clear evidence of a specific version-specific API.
3. A list of requirements.txt lines with an empty list since there are no third-party dependencies in the provided extracted APIs.
