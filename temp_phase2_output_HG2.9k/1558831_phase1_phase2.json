Here is the final JSON object for the provided extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vanilla": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["vanilla.FloatingWindow", "vanilla.SquareButton", "vanilla.EditText"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "NudgeCore": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "NudgeCore>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["NudgeCore.nudgeSelected"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib APIs.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of dependencies with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. If the version range cannot be determined, it is set to null.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty array, as there are no third-party packages used in this project.
