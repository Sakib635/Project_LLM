Here is the JSON output for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["django.db.connection.cursor.execute introduced in Django 1.2.0 → max Python 3.7"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Explanation:

* The Python version range is inferred to be between 3.4 and 3.7 based on the presence of `pathlib` in version 3.4 and the absence of `time.clock` in version 3.8.
* The `django` package is not included in the output because it does not have any APIs that are specific to a particular version range.
* The `requirements.txt` field is empty because there are no third-party dependencies in the extracted APIs.
