Here is the final JSON object for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "pandas": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["pandas.read_csv introduced in v0.20.3"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "numpy": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["numpy.random.seed introduced in v1.15.4"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "matplotlib": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["matplotlib.pyplot introduced in v3.1.0"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
In this JSON object, the `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum Python version allowed is 3.7 based on the extracted APIs provided. The `dependencies` field contains information about the inferred version ranges for each external package used in the project, along with evidence of introduction/deprecation versions and confidence levels. Finally, the `requirements.txt` field is empty as there are no third-party packages in the given list of extracted APIs.
