In this JSON object:

* The `python_version` field contains the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs, with evidence for each version range and notes indicating assumptions.
* The `dependencies` field contains a list of all external packages used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges (if any), recommended requirements lines (if any), evidence for each package's version range, confidence rating, and notes (if any).
* The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all third-party package dependencies required for the project, formatted as recommended requirement lines.

Note that some packages have their inferred version ranges set to null because they could not be determined based on the extracted APIs.
