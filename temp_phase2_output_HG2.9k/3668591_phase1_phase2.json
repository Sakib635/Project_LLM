}
Notes:
* The Python version range is inferred based on the stdlib APIs used.
* The version ranges for each external package are inferred based on the introduced/deprecated APIs provided.
* The confidence score is a measure of how confident we can be in the version range inference.
* The notes field contains any assumptions or additional information about the inference process.
