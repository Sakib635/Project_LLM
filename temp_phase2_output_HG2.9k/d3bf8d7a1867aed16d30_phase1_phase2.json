```
The JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib APIs.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary containing information about each external package used in the code, including:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: The inferred version range for each package based on extracted APIs.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: A recommended requirements line for each package based on the inferred version range.
	+ `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ `confidence`: The confidence level for each package, ranging from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest).
	+ `notes`: Any additional notes or assumptions about the package's version requirements.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty list indicating that there are no third-party packages in the code.

Note that the JSON object is structured according to the given schema and contains only valid JSON data, with no markdown, extra text, or comments.
