Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=2.0,<3.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "django>=2.0,<3.0",
      "evidence": ["django.test.TestCase introduced in Django 2.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "re": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["re.sub introduced in Python 3.5"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "django>=2.0,<3.0",
    "re>=3.5,<4.0"
  ]
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python version ranges based on the extracted APIs.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of package names mapped to their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The keys are the package names, and the values are objects with the following fields:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: The inferred version range for the package based on the extracted APIs.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: The recommended requirements line for the package based on the extracted APIs.
	+ `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping the APIs to their introduction and deprecation versions.
	+ `confidence`: A confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the certainty of the inferred version range and recommended requirements line.
	+ `notes`: Optional notes or assumptions.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, with each line formatted as `"<package>=<version>,<version>"`

Note that some dependencies may have no inferred version range or recommended requirements line, indicating that the version range cannot be accurately determined based on the extracted APIs.
