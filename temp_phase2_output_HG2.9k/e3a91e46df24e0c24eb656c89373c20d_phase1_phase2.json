}

The "python_version" field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum Python version allowed is 3.7, based on the standard library APIs used in the code. The "dependencies" field contains information about the external packages used in the code, including their inferred version ranges (if any) and recommended requirements lines (if any). The "requirements.txt" field contains a list of all recommended requirements lines for all dependencies.

Note that this is just an example output, and the actual output may vary based on the specific APIs used in the code and the external packages installed.
