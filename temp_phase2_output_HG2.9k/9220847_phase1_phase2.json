In this JSON object, we have inferred the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the usage of standard library APIs (datetime, remote_gae, ndb, experiments). The Python version range is determined to be [3.4, 3.7].

For each external package, we have provided the inferred version range and the recommended requirements line based on the API usage. For example, for the package "ndb", we have inferred that it was introduced in Python 3.4 and that its version range is [3.4, 3.5). The recommended requirements line is "google-cloud-ndb>=1.0.0,<2.0.0".

The JSON object also includes the evidence and notes for each dependency and package.
