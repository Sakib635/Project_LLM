Here is the final JSON object:

  },
  "requirements.txt": [

  ]
}
```
Note that the Python version range is inferred based on the stdlib APIs used in the project, and the external package versions are inferred based on the introduced/deprecation of specific APIs. The `evidence` field contains short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, and the `confidence` field indicates the level of confidence in the version range and recommendation.
