Here is the JSON object that I have inferred based on the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "MeCab": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["MeCab.Tagger", "MeCab.Tagger.parseToNode"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "string": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["string.encode"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "node": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["node.next"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "m": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["m.parseToNode"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: The Python version range (min, max) based on stdlib APIs. In this case, the min version is 3.4 and the max version is 3.7.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of external packages used in the project, with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. For each package, I have set the `inferred_version_range` to null since I cannot determine a reliable upper or lower bound for the version range based on the extracted APIs provided. The `recommended_requirements_line` is also set to null since I cannot determine the exact version of the package being used in the project.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty array, as no third-party packages are used in the project.

Please note that this JSON object is just an inference and may not be entirely accurate, as it relies on the extracted APIs provided by the user.
