Here is the JSON object for the provided extracted APIs:
{
"python_version": {
"min": "3.4",
"max": "3.7",
"evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
"notes": ""
},
"dependencies": {
"mice": {
"inferred_version_range": null,
"recommended_requirements_line": null,
"evidence": ["mice.m.getAllServers", "mice.m.newServer", "mice.m.getServer", "mice.m.getDefaultConf", "mice.m.setConf", "mice.m.start"],
"confidence": 0,
"notes": ""
}
},
"requirements.txt": []
}
Note that the JSON object includes the minimum and maximum Python versions based on the extracted stdlib APIs, as well as information about the inferred version range for each external package (in this case, none) and the recommended requirements lines for all dependencies. The "evidence" field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, while the "confidence" field indicates the level of confidence in the inferred version range.
