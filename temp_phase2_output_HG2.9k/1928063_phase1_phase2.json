Here is the final JSON object:

{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.5,<2",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "Django>=1.5,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["django.template.Library.register introduced in Django 1.5"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "capture": {

      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["capture"],

    },
    "django.template.Node": {

      "evidence": ["django.template.Node.render introduced in Django 1.2"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "CaptureNode": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["CaptureNode.__init__", "CaptureNode.render"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
Note that the "python_version" field contains the minimum and maximum Python versions inferred from the stdlib APIs used in the project, while the "dependencies" field contains the version ranges for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided.
The "evidence" field in each dependency's object contains a list of short statements linking the stdlib API usage to the Python version addition/removal. The "confidence" field indicates the level of confidence that the version range is accurate, with higher values indicating greater certainty. The "notes" field may contain additional information or assumptions.
The "requirements.txt" field contains a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.
Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual JSON object might have more fields or different content depending on the project's specific requirements.
