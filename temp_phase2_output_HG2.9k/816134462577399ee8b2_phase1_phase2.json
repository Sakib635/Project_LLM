```
This JSON object includes the following information:

* The Python version range (min, max) based on stdlib APIs.
* The most likely version range for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided.
* requirements.txt (only third-party packages' recommended lines).

The "python_version" field includes the min and max Python versions inferred from the extracted API calls, along with evidence and notes explaining why these versions were chosen.

The "dependencies" field contains information about each external package used in the project. For each package, it includes:

* The inferred version range (null if none) based on the extracted APIs for that package.
* The recommended requirements line for installing the package (null if none).
* Evidence and notes explaining why this version range or requirements line were chosen.
* Confidence level of the inference, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.

The "requirements.txt" field contains a list of all third-party packages' recommended requirements lines.
