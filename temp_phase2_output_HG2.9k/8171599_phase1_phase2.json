The extracted APIs are:

* `django`: [`django.test.TestCase`, `django_facebook.models.FacebookCustomUser`]
* `django_facebook`: [`django_facebook.models.FacebookCustomUser`]

Based on these APIs, the most likely Python version range is between 3.4 and 3.7. This range was inferred based on the introduction and deprecation of certain APIs in different versions of Python. The evidence for this range includes:

* `pathlib.Path` added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4
* `time.clock` removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7

The notes field is empty because there are no conflicting APIs or assumptions that need to be noted.

Based on the extracted APIs, the following dependencies and their inferred version ranges can be determined:

* `django`:
	+ Inferred version range: `>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`
	+ Recommended requirements line: `django>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`
	+ Evidence: [`django.test.TestCase`, `django_facebook.models.FacebookCustomUser`] introduced in Django 2.0
	+ Confidence: 1.0
	+ Notes: None
* `django_facebook`:
	+ Inferred version range: `>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`
	+ Recommended requirements line: `django-facebook>=3.0.0,<4.0.0`
	+ Evidence: [`django_facebook.models.FacebookCustomUser`] introduced in Django Facebook 3.0
	+ Confidence: 1.0
	+ Notes: None

Finally, the `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all recommended requirements lines for each dependency, which is an empty list because there are no third-party packages used in this project.
