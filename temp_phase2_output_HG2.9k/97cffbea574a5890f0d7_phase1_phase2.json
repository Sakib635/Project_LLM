Notes:
* The Python version range is determined based on the stdlib APIs used, with a conservative upper bound of 3.7.
* For external packages, the version ranges are inferred based on the added and deprecated APIs in each package.
* The confidence values for each package depend on the availability of sufficient evidence to determine the version range with high certainty.
* The notes field provides additional information about each package's version inference.
* requirements.txt is an empty list since no third-party packages are used.
