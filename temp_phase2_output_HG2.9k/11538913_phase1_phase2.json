  ]
}
Notes:
* The minimum Python version is inferred to be 3.4 and the maximum is 3.7 based on evidence of the presence of `pathlib.Path` in Python 3.4 and the absence of `time.clock` in Python 3.8.
* For each dependency, an `inferred_version_range` and a `recommended_requirements_line` are provided. The `inferred_version_range` is based on evidence of the presence or absence of specific APIs, while the `recommended_requirements_line` is derived from the `inferred_version_range`. The confidence for each dependency is set to 0.5 because it was not possible to determine a reliable upper or lower bound.
* For the `requirements.txt` field, the final list of recommended requirements lines is provided based on the inferred version ranges and evidence.

Note:
The returned JSON object strictly follows the schema, but the output may be different from what you expect if the input data contains ambiguity or uncertainty.
It's important to note that this is a simplified example, and the actual results may vary depending on the complexity of the APIs and their dependencies.
You can customize the output by changing the fields in the schema, but please make sure that the structure remains the same as per the requirements.
