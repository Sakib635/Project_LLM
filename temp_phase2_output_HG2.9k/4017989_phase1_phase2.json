Note that the final JSON object only contains the minimum and maximum Python versions inferred based on the extracted APIs, as well as an empty list for the `dependencies` field since we cannot determine reliable version ranges for scipy and matplotlib.
The `notes` field is also included to explain why we are unable to provide reliable version ranges for these packages.
