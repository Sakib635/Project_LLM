```
This JSON object satisfies the requirements for Python version and external packages as follows:

* For Python version, the minimum required version is 3.4 (based on `pathlib.Path` addition) and the maximum allowed version is 3.7 (based on `time.clock` removal). The confidence level for this information is 0.5.
* For the external package "django", no inferred version range can be determined, so it is set to null. The recommended requirements line is also null. The evidence for this package consists of a single statement that suggests the package was added in Django 3.4 (based on `django.conf.settings` addition). The confidence level for this information is 0.5.
* For the external package "debug_toolbar", an inferred version range of `>=1.2.0,<2.0.0` can be determined based on API introduction in Django 3.4 (based on `debug_toolbar.urls` addition). The recommended requirements line is also `>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`. The evidence for this package consists of a single statement that suggests the package was added in Django 3.4 (based on `debug_toolbar.urls` addition). The confidence level for this information is 1.0.
* For the "requirements.txt" field, the recommended requirements lines are included for both "django" and "debug_toolbar".
