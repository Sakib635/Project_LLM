Here is the JSON object for the given extracted APIs:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "simplegui": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": "simplegui is a custom library, not part of the Python stdlib"
    },
    "random": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=2.1,<3",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "random>=2.1,<3",
      "evidence": ["random.random added in Python 2.1 → min Python 2.1", "random.seed removed in Python 3 → max Python 2.7"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "random>=2.1,<3"
  ]
}
Note that the JSON schema is not strictly followed due to the lack of evidence for the version range of the simplegui package and the uncertainty in the time.clock API removal.
Also, the requirements.txt file only contains the recommended_requirements_line for random because it is the only third-party package used in the extracted APIs.
