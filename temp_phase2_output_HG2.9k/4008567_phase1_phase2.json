Here is the JSON object that corresponds to the provided extracted APIs:
```json

  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },

    },
    "ProtocolRelativeS3BotoStorage": {

      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided. The `min` field indicates the minimum Python version required, while the `max` field indicates the maximum Python version allowed, or null if there is no upper bound. The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, and the `notes` field contains optional assumptions.
* `dependencies`: an object containing information about each external package used in the project. Each package has an `inferred_version_range` field that indicates the most likely version range for that package based on the extracted APIs provided, or null if the version cannot be determined. The `recommended_requirements_line` field contains a recommended requirements line for each dependency, which is a string in the format "pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C", where X.Y.Z is the minimum version required and A.B.C is the upper bound (if any). The `evidence` field contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions for each dependency, while the `confidence` field indicates the degree of confidence in the inferred version range for that package (0.0–1.0). The `notes` field contains optional conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items for each dependency.
* `requirements.txt`: an empty list indicating no third-party packages are required to be installed via requirements.txt.

Note that the output JSON object is valid and adheres strictly to the JSON schema provided.
