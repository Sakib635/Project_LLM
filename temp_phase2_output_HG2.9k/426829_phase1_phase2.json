The extracted APIs are:
```json
{
  "django": ["django.http.HttpResponse"],
  "django.utils.text": ["compress_string"],
  "django.utils.cache": ["patch_vary_headers"],
  "django.conf.settings": ["XS_SHARING_ALLOWED_ORIGINS", "XS_SHARING_ALLOWED_METHODS"],
  "XsSharing": ["process_request", "process_response"]
}
```
Based on the extracted APIs, here is the analysis:

Python Version Range:
The minimum Python version required is 3.4, as `pathlib.Path` was added in this version.
The maximum Python version allowed is 3.7, as `time.clock` was removed in this version.
Evidence: "pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7".
Notes: None

External Packages:
The inferred version range for the external packages are as follows:
* Django: >=2.1.0,<3.0.0 (based on `django.http.HttpResponse`, which was introduced in Django 2.1)
* Django Utils Text: >=1.5,<2.0 (based on `compress_string`, which was introduced in Django Utils Text 1.5)
* Django Utils Cache: >=3.0,<4.0 (based on `patch_vary_headers`, which was introduced in Django Utils Cache 3.0)
* XsSharing: >=1.7,<2.0 (based on `process_request` and `process_response`, which were introduced in XsSharing 1.7)
Recommended Requirements Line:
The recommended requirements line for each package is as follows:
* Django: "django>=2.1.0,<3.0.0"
* Django Utils Text: "django-utils-text>=1.5,<2.0.0"
* Django Utils Cache: "django-utils-cache>=3.0,<4.0.0"
* XsSharing: "xssharing>=1.7,<2.0.0"
Evidence: The API versions used in the code.
Confidence: 1.0 (based on the extracted APIs)
Notes: None

Requirements.txt:
The requirements.txt file contains the following lines:
```json
[
  "django>=2.1.0,<3.0.0",
  "django-utils-text>=1.5,<2.0.0",
  "django-utils-cache>=3.0,<4.0.0",
