Explanation:

* The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum version allowed is 3.7 based on the evidence provided.
* The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used in the project, including their inferred version ranges (if any) and recommended requirements lines (if any). In this case, we have three packages: `simplejson`, `django.contrib.sessions.backends.base`, and `django_ext.redis_helper`.
* The `inferred_version_range` field specifies the minimum and maximum versions that are required for each package based on the evidence provided. In the case of `simplejson`, there is no information about its version range, so it is set to `null`. Similarly, we do not have any information about `django_ext.redis_helper`'s version range, so it is also set to `null`.
* The `recommended_requirements_line` field specifies the recommended requirements line for each package based on the evidence provided. In the case of `django.contrib.sessions.backends.base`, we have a single piece of evidence that suggests this package was introduced in Django 1.0, which means its version range is limited to `<=1.8`.
* The `evidence` field contains short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal. In the case of `simplejson`, there is no information about its API usage, so it is empty. For `django.contrib.sessions.backends.base`, we have a single piece of evidence that suggests this package was introduced in Django 1.0, which means its version range is limited to `<=1.8`.
* The `confidence` field specifies the confidence level for each package's inferred version range and recommended requirements line based on the evidence provided. In the case of `simplejson`, we have no information about its API usage, so the confidence level is 0.0. For `django.contrib.sessions.backends.base`, we have a single piece of evidence that suggests this package was introduced in Django 1.0, which means its version range is limited to `<=1.8`.
* The `notes` field contains any additional notes or assumptions about the packages and their inferred version ranges/recommended requirements lines. In this case, there are no additional notes.
* The `requirements.txt` field specifies the list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies. Since we have no information about the versions of these packages, we do not include any recommendations in this field.
