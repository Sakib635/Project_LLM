Here is the final JSON object:
```json

    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {

    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object with the minimum and maximum Python version required for the project, as well as a list of evidence statements that explain why these versions were chosen.
* `dependencies`: an object with keys corresponding to each dependency in the `extracted_apis` field, and values containing information about the inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence statements, confidence, and notes for each dependency. If the minimum or maximum Python version was not determined, the corresponding field will be set to null.
* `requirements.txt`: an empty list. The `requirements.txt` file is not included in the output because it is generated automatically when running `pip freeze`.
