Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "sunrise": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["sunrise.colors", "sunrise.rgb", "sunrise.adjust", "sunrise.key_equal", "sunrise.equal", "sunrise.move"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "blinkt": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["blinkt.set_pixel", "blinkt.show"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object has the following fields:

* `python_version`: An object with three fields:
	+ `min`: The minimum Python version required, which is "3.4" in this case.
	+ `max`: The maximum Python version allowed, which is "3.7" in this case.
	+ `evidence`: A list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal. In this case, there are two statements:
		- "pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4"
		- "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"
* `dependencies`: An object with two dependencies (`sunrise` and `blinkt`). Each dependency has the following fields:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: A string representing the version range, which is null for both dependencies in this case.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: A string representing the recommended requirements line, which is also null for both dependencies in this case.
	+ `evidence`: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. In this case, there are two statements:
		- "sunrise.colors"
		- "blinkt.set_pixel"
	+ `confidence`: A float representing the confidence level (0.0–1.0) of the version inference. For both dependencies in this case, the confidence is 0.0.
	+ `notes`: An optional string with additional notes, which is an empty string for both dependencies in this case.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of strings representing the recommended requirements lines, which is an empty list in this case.

Note that the JSON object only contains information about the two dependencies (`sunrise` and `blinkt`) and their version inference based on the extracted APIs provided. It does not contain any other information about the project or its environment.
