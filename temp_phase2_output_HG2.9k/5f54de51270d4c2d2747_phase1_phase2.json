Here is the final JSON object:

```
Note that the inferred version range for Django is null because there is no clear indication of the minimum and maximum version required in the extracted APIs. The confidence level is set to 0.5 because we can only make an educated guess based on the API names mentioned in the list.

The same applies to the numpy package, where we cannot determine a reliable upper or lower bound for the version range. The recommended requirements line is therefore also null.
