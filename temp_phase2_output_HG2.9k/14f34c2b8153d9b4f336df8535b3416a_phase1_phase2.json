This JSON object includes the following information:

* The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs provided (minimum version is "3.4", maximum version is "3.7").
* The inferred version range for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided, with a confidence level of 0.6. For example, the "tensorflow" package is inferred to have a version range of null (meaning there is no clear upper or lower bound), and the "input_data" package is also inferred to have a version range of null.
* The recommended requirements line for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided, with a confidence level of 0.6. For example, the "tensorflow" package is recommended to have a requirements line of null (meaning there is no clear upper or lower bound), and the "input_data" package is also recommended to have a requirements line of null.
* The evidence for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided, which includes the names of the APIs that were detected as being introduced or deprecated in those packages. For example, the "tensorflow" package has evidence for the APIs "tensorflow.placeholder", "tensorflow.Variable", "tensorflow.nn.dropout", "tensorflow.matmul", "tensorflow.reduce_mean", and "tensorflow.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits".
* The notes field is empty in this example, but it could include additional information or assumptions about the packages and their dependencies.
* The requirements.txt field includes an empty list, as there are no recommended requirements lines for any external packages.
