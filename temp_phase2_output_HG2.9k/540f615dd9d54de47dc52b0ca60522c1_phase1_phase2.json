The final JSON object includes the following fields:

* `python_version`: An object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on stdlib APIs.
* `dependencies`: An object with one field per external package, each containing the following subfields:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: A string representing the inferred version range for the package, or null if it cannot be determined.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: A string representing the recommended requirements line for the package, or null if it cannot be determined.
	+ `evidence`: An array of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ `confidence`: A number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the confidence in the inferred version range and recommended requirements line.
	+ `notes`: Optional assumptions or conflicting APIs that may affect the accuracy of the inference.
* `requirements.txt`: An array of strings representing the recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, excluding stdlib packages.

The JSON object is valid according to the specified schema and is human-readable formatted with 2 spaces of indentation.

Note that the final JSON object may include additional fields or subfields as needed to provide a complete representation of the inference results.
