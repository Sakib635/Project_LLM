Here is the final JSON object:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "c4d": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "sys": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=2.6,<3",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "sys>=2.6,<3",
      "evidence": ["sys.exit introduced in sys 2.6 → min Python 2.6"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "sys>=2.6,<3"
  ]
}
The JSON object includes the following fields:
* python_version: The inferred Python version range based on standard library APIs.
* dependencies: A dictionary of package names and their inferred version ranges.
* requirements.txt: A list of recommended requirements lines for all external packages.

Note that some of the fields in each dependency object are null or empty, as they cannot be determined with certainty based on the extracted APIs provided.
