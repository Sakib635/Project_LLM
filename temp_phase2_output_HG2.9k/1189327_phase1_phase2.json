Here is the final JSON object based on the provided extracted APIs:
```json

    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],

    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum Python version allowed is 3.7. The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used, including their inferred version range and recommended requirements line. In this case, there is no evidence found for the `gtk`, `shlex`, or `os` packages. Therefore, the fields for these packages are set to null.

The `evidence` field lists the APIs that were used to infer the version range for each package, while the `confidence` field indicates the level of confidence in the inferred version range. In this case, the confidence for the `os` package is 0.75, indicating that there is some evidence found for the API introduction/deprecation versions.

The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies, which in this case is empty because no external packages were identified.
