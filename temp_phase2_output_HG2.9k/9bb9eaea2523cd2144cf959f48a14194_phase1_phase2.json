Here is the final JSON object:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=2.0,<2.1",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "django>=2.0,<2.1",
      "evidence": ["AnonymousUser introduced in Django 2.0"],
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "rest_framework": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=3.0,<4.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "djangorestframework>=3.0,<4.0",
      "evidence": ["Request introduced in DRF 3.0", "authenticate() introduced in DRF 3.0", "get_user() introduced in DRF 3.0"],
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "django>=2.0,<2.1",
    "djangorestframework>=3.0,<4.0"
  ]
}
Note that the JSON object has the following fields:
* python_version: an object containing the minimum and maximum Python versions required for the project, along with evidence and notes.
* dependencies: an object containing inference information for each external package used in the project, along with recommended requirements lines, evidence, confidence levels, and notes.
* requirements.txt: a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies in the project.

Each dependency's JSON object has the following fields:
* inferred_version_range: a string containing a version range inference for the package, or null if no such inference can be made.
* recommended_requirements_line: a string containing a recommended requirements line for the package, or null if no such line exists.
* evidence: an array of strings containing evidence for the inference and requirements line.
* confidence: a float representing the level of confidence in the inference and requirements line (0.0-1.0).
* notes: an optional string containing additional information or assumptions about the inference and requirements line.

Please note that this is just an example, and the actual JSON object may vary based on your project's specific requirements and dependencies.
