Here is the final JSON object:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "django": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "cms": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "os": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["os.path.exists"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
Note that the "inferred_version_range" and "recommended_requirements_line" fields for each dependency are null, as they cannot be determined based on the provided extracted APIs.
The "evidence" field contains a list of extracted API calls for each package, which is empty in this case.
The "confidence" field is set to 0.0 for all dependencies, indicating that no inference can be made about their version requirements.
Finally, the "requirements.txt" field is an empty array, as there are no third-party packages used in the provided list of extracted APIs.
This JSON object meets the schema and only includes relevant information, such as the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on stdlib APIs and the evidence for each dependency's inferred version range.
Please note that this is a simplified response, and you may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements.
