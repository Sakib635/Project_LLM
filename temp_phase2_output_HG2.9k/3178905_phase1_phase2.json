In this JSON object, we have:

* `python_version`: The Python version range inferred based on the stdlib APIs used. It includes the minimum and maximum versions required by the code. In this case, the minimum version is 3.4 and the maximum version is 3.7.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of dependencies and their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. For each dependency, we have:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: The inferred version range based on the stdlib APIs used for that package. If no such inference can be made, this field is set to null.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: A recommended requirements line based on the inferred version range. If no such line can be generated, this field is set to null.
	+ `evidence`: A list of evidence statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions for that package.
	+ `confidence`: A confidence score between 0 and 1 indicating the level of confidence in the inferred version range and recommended requirements line.
	+ `notes`: Optional notes about the inference or any assumptions made during the process.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty list, as there are no third-party packages used in this code example.
