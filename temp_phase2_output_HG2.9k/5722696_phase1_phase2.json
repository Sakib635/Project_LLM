This JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib APIs.
* `dependencies`: A list of dependencies used in the project, with their inferred version range (if known) and recommended requirements line (if available).
* `requirements.txt`: An empty array, as no requirements file was provided.

Note that some of the dependencies have an inference confidence of 0.5, indicating that we are not confident in our ability to determine their version ranges with certainty.
