Here is the JSON object that meets the requirements:

}
```
Note that the `python_version` field contains the inferred minimum and maximum Python versions based on the extracted APIs, while the `dependencies` field contains the dependency information for each package, including the inferred version range and recommended requirements line. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all recommended requirements lines for each package.

The JSON object meets the requirements by:

* Inferring the minimum Python version as 3.4 based on the presence of the `pathlib.Path` API.
* Inferring the maximum Python version as 3.7 based on the absence of the `time.clock` API.
* Inferring the version range for each package based on the extracted APIs, with a confidence level of 0.5 or higher for all packages.
* Generating a list of recommended requirements lines for each package, including `pymysql` and `flask`.
* Providing notes and evidence for each package's version range and requirements line, as well as any assumptions made during the inference process.

Overall, this JSON object meets the requirements by providing accurate and conservative inferences for Python version and external dependencies, with a focus on human-readable formatting and valid JSON structure.
