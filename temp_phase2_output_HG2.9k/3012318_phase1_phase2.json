Note that the `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum version allowed is 3.7. The `dependencies` field contains information about each package used in the project, including the inferred version range for each package and a recommended requirements line. Finally, the `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all third-party dependencies used in the project, along with their recommended versions.
