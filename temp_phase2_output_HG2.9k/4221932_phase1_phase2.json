Note: The final JSON object includes the following fields:

* python_version: Provides the minimum and maximum Python version required based on the extracted APIs provided. The evidence field contains short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, while the notes field provides optional assumptions.
* dependencies: Provides details about each external package used in the project, including the inferred version range (if applicable), recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence, and notes for each package. The evidence field contains short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, while the notes field provides optional information such as conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items.
* requirements.txt: Provides a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.
