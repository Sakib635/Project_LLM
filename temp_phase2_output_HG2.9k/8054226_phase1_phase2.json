Here is the final JSON object:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "usb": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["usb.busses", "usb.devices"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "sys": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["sys.stderr.write", "sys.exit"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The output includes the following information:

1. The Python version range (min, max) based on stdlib APIs.
2. The most likely version range for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided.
3. requirements.txt (only third-party packages' recommended lines).

Note that the output is only valid JSON and does not include any additional information or formatting beyond what is required by the schema.
