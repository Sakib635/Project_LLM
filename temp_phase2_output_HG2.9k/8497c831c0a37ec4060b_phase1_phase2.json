The JSON object returned based on the given extracted APIs is as follows:
```json

  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },

  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
    "numpy>=1.18.0,<2.0.0"
  ]
}
```
In this JSON object, we can see that the minimum Python version required is 3.4, and the maximum Python version allowed is 3.7. We also have information about the versions of the external packages used, including their inferred version ranges (e.g., pandas >=1.2.0, <2.0.0) and recommended requirements lines (e.g., "pandas>=1.2.0,<2.0.0"). Finally, we have a list of all dependencies in the project's requirements.txt file.
