Here is the final JSON object based on the provided extracted APIs:
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "maya": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["APIs may have been introduced in different versions of Maya"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "mayautils": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["APIs may have been introduced in different versions of Maya"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
The JSON object includes the following information:

* python_version: The minimum and maximum Python version required based on stdlib APIs. The evidence field provides short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* dependencies: A dictionary of packages with their inferred version range, recommended requirements line, evidence, confidence, and notes. The evidence field provides short statements mapping APIs to introduction or deprecation versions. Confidence is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating the certainty of the version inference.
* requirements.txt: A list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies.

Note that the inferred version range and recommended requirements line are both null for the maya and mayautils packages, indicating that the versions cannot be reliably determined based on the provided APIs.

The confidence values in the JSON object indicate the certainty of each dependency's version inference. The values range from 0.0 (low confidence) to 1.0 (high confidence). In this case, both packages have a medium-level confidence value indicating that the version inferences are reasonable but not definitive based on the provided APIs.

The evidence field provides short statements linking the stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal and mapping APIs to introduction or deprecation versions. These statements can help users understand why certain versions of packages were recommended or excluded from the JSON object's dependencies dictionary.

Overall, the JSON object provides a reliable and conservative estimate of the required Python version range and dependencies based on the provided extracted APIs.
