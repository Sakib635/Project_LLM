Note that this output only contains the final JSON object, and does not contain any additional information such as markdown or comments. The "python_version" field indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the stdlib APIs used, while the "dependencies" field contains the inferred version range and recommended requirements line for each external package.
The "confidence" field in each dependency item represents the level of confidence in the inference, with higher values indicating more reliable inferences. The "notes" field includes any additional information or assumptions that were made during the inference process.
