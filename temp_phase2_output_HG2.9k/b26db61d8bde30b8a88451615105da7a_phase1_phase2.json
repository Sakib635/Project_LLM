Note that the version ranges and requirements lines are based on the extracted APIs provided, but may not be precise as some APIs may have been introduced or deprecated in earlier versions of Python, or may not be part of the public API.
The JSON object also includes a "requirements.txt" field which is empty since there are no external packages used in this example.
Please let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with other input data.
I hope this helps!
