This JSON object satisfies the requirements for both Python version and external packages. The `python_version` field contains the inferred range of Python versions based on the stdlib APIs, with a minimum version of 3.4 and a maximum version of 3.7. The `dependencies` field contains information about each external package used in the project, including the inferred version range for each package (if possible), a recommended requirements line for each package (if possible), and an evidence field with short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions. The `requirements.txt` field is a list of all dependencies' recommended_requirements_line.

Please note that the confidence value for each dependency is 0.0, as this information can be inferred only from the extracted APIs and not based on any other external factors.
