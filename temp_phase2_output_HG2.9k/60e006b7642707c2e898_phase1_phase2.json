  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
The JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on stdlib APIs.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of package names and their inferred version ranges, as well as recommended requirements lines.
* `requirements.txt`: An empty list since there are no third-party dependencies in the provided extracted APIs.

The `python_version` field has the following information:

* `min`: The minimum Python version required based on stdlib APIs, which is "3.4".
* `max`: The maximum Python version allowed based on stdlib APIs, which is "3.7".
* `evidence`: A list of statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* `notes`: An empty string since there are no assumptions or conflicting APIs.

The `dependencies` field has the following information:

* Each package name is associated with its inferred version range, as well as recommended requirements line. The `gimpfu` and `python_fu_scale_half` packages have null versions since they do not appear to be Python libraries.
* For each package, the `evidence` field contains a list of statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
* The `confidence` field represents the confidence in the inferred version range for each package, which is either 0.0 or 1.0 for packages that have no evidence.
* The `notes` field is empty since there are no conflicting APIs or assumptions.

The `requirements.txt` field is an empty list since there are no third-party dependencies in the provided extracted APIs.
