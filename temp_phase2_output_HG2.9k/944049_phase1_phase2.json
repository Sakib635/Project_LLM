Here is the JSON object for the provided extracted APIs:

}
```
This JSON object includes the inferred Python version range (minimum required: 3.4, maximum allowed: 3.7), the inferred versions and requirements lines for each dependency (pandas and numpy), and a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies in the form of a `requirements.txt` file.

Note that the `evidence` field contains short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal, which helps users understand why certain Python versions were chosen as minimum and maximum bounds. The `confidence` field indicates how confident the assistant is in each recommendation, with a value of 1.0 indicating a perfect match.
