Here is the JSON object with the inferred Python version range and external package versions:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "scene": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "scene>=1.0,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["scene.Scene introduced in v1.0", "scene.Scene.setup added in v1.0", "scene.Scene.draw added in v1.0", "scene.Scene.touch_began added in v1.0", "scene.Scene.touch_moved added in v1.0", "scene.Scene.touch_ended added in v1.0", "scene.Scene.pause introduced in v2.0", "scene.Scene.resume introduced in v2.0"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "phue": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "phue>=1.0,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["phue.Bridge introduced in v1.0"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Note that the confidence for each dependency is based on the number of APIs used from the package and whether those APIs have been introduced or deprecated in any version of Python within the inferred version range.
The `evidence` field for each dependency contains a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions, while the `notes` field may contain additional assumptions or conflicting APIs that were not taken into account during inference.

Please note that this is just an example output and the actual JSON object would depend on the input provided.
