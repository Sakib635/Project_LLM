  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
This output suggests that the extracted APIs indicate a minimum Python version of 3.4 and a maximum Python version of 3.7, based on the introduction/removal of specific API functions in different versions of Python. It also provides evidence for the inferred version ranges of external packages, such as Rhino, with a minimum version of 1.2 and a maximum version of 2.0, based on the introduction of specific APIs in those versions.
