Note: The output JSON object follows the schema provided and only contains valid JSON data.
The "python_version" field specifies the inferred Python version range based on the stdlib APIs used in the project. The "dependencies" field lists the external packages used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines (if applicable). Finally, the "requirements.txt" field contains a list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines.
The confidence values for each package are based on the evidence provided and reflect how confidently the assistant can determine the package's version range and requirements line.
