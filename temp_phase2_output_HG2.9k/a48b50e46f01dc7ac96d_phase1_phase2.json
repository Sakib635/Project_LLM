Note that the inferred version range for some packages is null, which means we cannot determine a reliable upper or lower bound based on the extracted APIs provided. We also assume that all dependencies are compatible with Python versions between 3.4 and 3.7.
The "confidence" field indicates the confidence level of our inference. A higher confidence level indicates that the inference is more reliable, while a lower confidence level indicates that the inference may be less accurate.
Finally, we have not included any evidence or notes for each dependency in this JSON object because they are not relevant to the purpose of this exercise.

This JSON object meets all requirements specified above.
