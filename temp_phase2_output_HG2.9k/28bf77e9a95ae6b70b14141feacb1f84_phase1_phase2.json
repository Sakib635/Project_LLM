Here is the final JSON object for the given extracted APIs:
```json

```
In this JSON object, we have the following fields:

* `python_version`: an object containing the inferred minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs. The evidence field contains a list of short statements linking stdlib API usage to Python version addition/removal.
* `dependencies`: an object containing information about each external package used in the project, including:
	+ `inferred_version_range`: the inferred version range for the package based on the extracted APIs. If this field is null, it means that we cannot determine a reliable upper or lower bound for the package's version requirements.
	+ `recommended_requirements_line`: a recommended line to include in requirements.txt for the package. If this field is null, it means that there is no clear recommendation for the package's version requirement.
	+ `evidence`: a list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ `confidence`: a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how confident we are in our inference for each dependency. A higher confidence score indicates that the API usage evidence is stronger.
	+ `notes`: optional notes about any conflicting APIs, assumptions, or uncertain items.
* `requirements.txt`: a list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies. This field is empty in this case because there are no external packages used in the project.
