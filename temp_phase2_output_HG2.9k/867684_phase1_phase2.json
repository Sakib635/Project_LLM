This JSON object includes the following information:

* The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the standard library APIs used (minimum version is 3.4, maximum version is 3.7).
* The version ranges inferred for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided (null for os and sys packages as they are not third-party dependencies).
* The recommended requirements lines for all third-party dependencies.
* The confidence level of the version range inference for each dependency.
* Notes explaining any assumptions or limitations in the version range inference.
* The requirements.txt file is empty as no third-party packages were found.
