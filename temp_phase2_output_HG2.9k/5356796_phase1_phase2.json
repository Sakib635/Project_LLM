Here is the final JSON object for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "random": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "markov": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2,<2",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "markov>=1.2,<2",
      "evidence": ["MarkovGenerator introduced in version 1.2", "CharacterMarkovGenerator introduced in version 1.2"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "markov>=1.2,<2"
  ]
}
```
Explanation:

* The `python_version` field indicates that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum version allowed is 3.7, based on the usage of the `pathlib.Path` and `time.clock` APIs.
* The `dependencies` field contains two entries: one for the `random` package and one for the `markov` package.
	+ For the `random` package, there is no information about its version range, so the `inferred_version_range` field is null.
	+ For the `markov` package, we can infer a version range of at least 1.2 and less than 2 based on the usage of the `MarkovGenerator` and `CharacterMarkovGenerator` APIs.
* The `requirements.txt` field contains only one entry: the recommended requirements line for the `markov` package, which is "markov>=1.2,<2".

Note that this JSON object is based on the provided extracted APIs and does not take into account any additional information about the project's dependencies or environment.
Also, it is important to note that the version ranges inferred are conservative, meaning they allow for older versions of the packages to be used without issue.
