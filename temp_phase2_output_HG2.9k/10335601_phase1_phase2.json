Here is the JSON output for the given extracted APIs:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "sublime_plugin": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["sublime_plugin.WindowCommand", "sublime_plugin.TextCommand"],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
This output suggests that the minimum Python version required is 3.4 and the maximum Python version allowed is 3.7 based on the stdlib APIs used in the codebase. The `sublime_plugin` package is inferred to be a dependency with no specific version range, as it was not mentioned in the extracted APIs.

Note that this output only includes information about the Python version and the `sublime_plugin` package, as it is not clear which other packages are used in the codebase. To get more detailed information about other dependencies, you may need to provide more context or extract additional information from the source code.
