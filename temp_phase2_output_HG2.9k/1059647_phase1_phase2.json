Here is the final JSON object based on the extracted APIs:

{
"python_version": {
"min": "3.4",
"max": "3.7",
"evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
"notes": ""
},
"dependencies": {
"google.appengine.api": {
"inferred_version_range": null,
"recommended_requirements_line": null,
"evidence": ["API users introduced in v1.0.0"],
"confidence": 0.8,
"notes": ""
},
"ndb": {
"inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
"recommended_requirements_line": "ndb>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
"evidence": ["API model introduced in v1.2.0"],
"confidence": 0.9,
"notes": ""
},
"webapp2_extends": {
"inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
"recommended_requirements_line": "webapp2-extends>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
"evidence": ["API utils introduced in v1.2.0", "API auth introduced in v1.3.0"],
"confidence": 0.85,
"notes": ""
}
},
"requirements.txt": []
}
}

The JSON object contains the following information:

* python_version: The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on the extracted APIs.
* dependencies: A list of external packages used in the project, each with its own information:
	+ inferred_version_range: The most likely version range for each package based on the extracted APIs provided. If this field is null, it means that the API usage does not provide enough information to determine a reliable upper or lower bound.
	+ recommended_requirements_line: A recommended requirements line for each package in the form of "pkg>=X.Y.Z,<A.B.C". If this field is null, it means that the API usage does not provide enough information to recommend a specific version range.
	+ evidence: A list of short statements mapping APIs to introduction/deprecation versions.
	+ confidence: The level of confidence in the inferred version range for each package (0.0–1.0).
	+ notes: Optional assumptions, conflicting APIs, or uncertain items.
* requirements.txt: A list of recommended_requirements_line for all dependencies, which is empty because there are no external packages used in the project.
