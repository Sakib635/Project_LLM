Note that this is just a sample output and may not be the exact version ranges required for your project.
Also, please note that the confidence scores are based on the provided extracted APIs, and they may not reflect the actual usage of those APIs in the codebase.
It's important to test and verify the generated requirements.txt file with a Python environment to ensure compatibility with the target runtime.

Note: The schema for the output JSON follows the expected structure as specified by the user prompt, including the fields "python_version", "dependencies" (containing inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines for each dependency), and "requirements.txt".
