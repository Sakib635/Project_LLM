The final JSON object contains the following information:

* `python_version`: The minimum and maximum Python versions that are required based on the stdlib APIs used. In this case, the minimum version is 3.4 and the maximum version is 3.7.
* `dependencies`: A dictionary of external packages used in the project, along with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The `blpapi` package has an inferred version range of `>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`, which means that any version greater than or equal to 1.2.0 but less than 2.0.0 is a suitable choice. The `recommended_requirements_line` for the `blpapi` package is `blpapi>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`.
* `datetime`: No external APIs in stdlib datetime, so the inferred version range is null and the recommended requirements line is null.
* `open`: No external APIs in stdlib open, so the inferred version range is null and the recommended requirements line is null.
* `flush`: No external APIs in stdlib flush, so the inferred version range is null and the recommended requirements line is null.
* `stop`: No external APIs in stdlib stop, so the inferred version range is null and the recommended requirements line is null.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of all the required packages, along with their recommended versions. This list is generated by concatenating the `recommended_requirements_line` fields for each package in the `dependencies` dictionary.
