Here is the JSON output for the given extracted APIs:

}
```
The output includes the following information:

* The minimum and maximum Python versions required based on stdlib APIs (minimum version 3.4, maximum version 3.7).
* The inferred version range for each external package used based on the extracted APIs provided (selenium: null, scrapy: ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0", time: null, lxml.html: ">=4.3.0,<4.4.0").
* The recommended requirements line for each dependency (scrapy: "scrapy>=1.2.0,<2.0.0", lxml.html: "lxml>=4.3.0,<4.4.0").
* The confidence level of the inference for each package (selenium: 0.5, scrapy: 1.0, time: 0.5, lxml.html: 1.0).
* Any additional notes or assumptions made during the inference process.

Note that the output only includes external packages used in the extracted APIs and does not include any dependencies for the Python standard library.
