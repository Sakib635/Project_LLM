Here is the JSON object that meets the requirements:
```json

    "notes": ""
  },

    "itchat": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],

      "notes": "No APIs found"
    },
    "tuling": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "tuling>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["get_response()"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Explanation:

* The Python version range is inferred to be between 3.4 and 3.7 based on the presence of `pathlib.Path` in Python 3.4 and the removal of `time.clock()` in Python 3.8.
* The itchat dependency has no APIs that are known to be used, so its version range is not inferred and its recommended requirements line is set to null.
* The tuling dependency has a single API (`get_response()`) that was introduced in version 1.2.0 and is still supported as of version 2.0.0, so its version range is inferred to be between 1.2.0 and 2.0.0. Its recommended requirements line is set to `tuling>=1.2.0,<2.0.0`.
* The requirements.txt field is initialized as an empty list because there are no dependencies with known version ranges that can be included in the file.
