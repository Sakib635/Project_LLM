Note: The inferred version range for each package is null because the APIs used in the extracted APIs are not sufficient to determine a reliable upper or lower bound, and the recommended requirements line is also null since there is no reliable way to infer the correct version of the package.
Also, the evidence field contains information about the usage of the API in the stdlib, which helps to explain why the version range cannot be determined.
