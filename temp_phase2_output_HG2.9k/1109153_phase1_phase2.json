Here is the final JSON object based on the extracted APIs and the provided Python version range:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "datetime": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": [],
      "confidence": 0.5,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "dateutil.relativedelta": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "dateutil.relativedelta>=1.2.0,<2.0.0",
      "evidence": ["dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta introduced in v1.2"],
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "datetime>=3.4",
    "dateutil.relativedelta>=1.2"
  ]
}
```
Note that the `python_version` field indicates the minimum and maximum Python versions required based on stdlib APIs, while the `dependencies` field lists the external packages used with their inferred version ranges and recommended requirements lines. The `requirements.txt` field contains a list of all dependencies' recommended requirements lines.
