Here is the final JSON object:
```
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "matplotlib": {
      "inferred_version_range": null,
      "recommended_requirements_line": null,
      "evidence": ["API X introduced in vM.N.P"],
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": []
}
```
Note that the `dependencies` key is a dictionary where each key represents a package and the value is an object with information about the package. The `inferred_version_range`, `recommended_requirements_line`, and `evidence` keys are not included in this JSON object as they were not provided in the input. The `confidence` and `notes` keys have default values of 0.0 and "" respectively.
