Note that the JSON object includes a `python_version` field with the minimum and maximum supported Python versions, as well as evidence for each version addition/removal based on the extracted APIs provided. The `dependencies` field contains an entry for each external package used in the codebase, along with its inferred version range (if any), recommended requirements line (if any), and confidence level. Finally, the `requirements.txt` field includes a list of all recommended requirements lines for each dependency.
