Here is the final JSON object for the given input:
```json
{
  "python_version": {
    "min": "3.4",
    "max": "3.7",
    "evidence": ["pathlib.Path added in Python 3.4 → min Python 3.4", "time.clock removed in Python 3.8 → max Python 3.7"],
    "notes": ""
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "flask": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=1.0,<2.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "Flask>=1.0,<2.0",
      "evidence": ["Flask.Response introduced in Flask 0.9 → min Flask 1.0", "Flask 1.0 added WSGI support"],
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "notes": ""
    },
    "flask.ext.login": {
      "inferred_version_range": ">=0.2,<1.0",
      "recommended_requirements_line": "Flask-Login>=0.2,<1.0",
      "evidence": ["Flask-Login 0.2 added support for Flask 1.0 → min Flask-Login 0.2"],
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "notes": ""
    }
  },
  "requirements.txt": [
    "flask>=1.0,<2.0",
    "Flask-Login>=0.2,<1.0"
  ]
}
```
This JSON object contains the following fields:

* `python_version`: This field indicates the minimum and maximum Python version required for the project, based on the extracted APIs. The minimum Python version is "3.4", and the maximum Python version is "3.7".
* `dependencies`: This field contains a dictionary of dependencies, where each key is the name of an external package and each value is an object with information about that package's version range and recommended requirements line. In this case, there are two dependencies: "flask" and "flask.ext.login".
* `requirements.txt`: This field contains a list of recommended requirements lines for all dependencies in the project.

The JSON object also includes some additional fields that provide more information about each dependency:

* `inferred_version_range`: This field indicates the version range inferred for each dependency based on the extracted APIs. In this case, the version ranges for "flask" and "flask.ext.login" are ">=1.0,<2.0" and ">=0.2,<1.0", respectively.
* `recommended_requirements_line`: This field contains a recommended requirements line for each dependency that can be added to the project's `requirements.txt` file. In this case, the recommended requirements lines are "flask>=1.0,<2.0" and "Flask-Login>=0.2,<1.0".
* `evidence`: This field contains a list of short statements that link each dependency's APIs to its Python version addition/removal. In this case, the evidence for "flask" includes statements about the introduction of WSGI support in Flask 1.0 and the removal of `time.clock` in Python 3.8.
* `confidence`: This field indicates the confidence level of each dependency's version range inference, where a higher value indicates more confidence. In this case, the confidence for "flask" is 0.85 and the confidence for "flask.ext.login" is 0.75.
* `notes`: This field contains any additional information or notes about each dependency's version range inference.

Overall, this JSON object provides a comprehensive view of the project's dependencies and their version ranges, as well as recommendations for adding those dependencies to the project's `requirements.txt` file.
